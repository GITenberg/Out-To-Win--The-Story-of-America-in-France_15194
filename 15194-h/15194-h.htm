    <h2>A PREFACE FOR FOOLS ONLY</h2>

    <p>I am not writing this preface for the conscious fool, but
    for his self-deceived brother who considers himself a very wise
    person. My hope is that some persons may recognise themselves
    and be provided with food for thought. They will usually be
    people who have contributed little to this war, except mean
    views and endless talk. Had they shared the sacrifice of it,
    they would have developed within themselves the faculty for a
    wider generosity. The extraordinary thing about generosity is
    its eagerness to recognise itself in others.</p>

    <p>You find these untravelled critics and mischief-makers on
    both sides of the Atlantic. In most cases they have no definite
    desire to work harm, but they have inherited cantankerous
    prejudices which date back to the American Revolution, and they
    lack the vision to perceive that this war, despite its horror
    and tragedy, is the God-given chance of centuries to re-unite
    the great Anglo-Saxon races of the world in a truer bond of
    kindness and kinship. If we miss this chance we are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"
       id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span> flinging in God's face His
       splendid recompense for our common heroism.</p>

    <p>It is an unfortunate fact that the merely foolish person
    constitutes as grave a danger as the deliberate plotter. His
    words, if they are acid enough, are quoted and re-quoted. They
    pass from mouth to mouth, gaining in authority. By the time
    they reach the friendly country at which they are directed,
    they have taken on the appearance of an opinion representative
    of a nation. The Hun is well aware of the value of gossip for
    the encouraging of divided counsels among his enemies. He
    invents a slander, pins it to some racial grievance, confides
    it to the fools among the Allies and leaves them to do the
    rest. Some of them wander about in a merely private capacity,
    nagging without knowledge, depositing poison, breeding doubts
    as to integrity, and all the while pretending to maintain a
    mildly impartial and judicial mental attitude. Their souls
    never rise from the ground. Their brains are gangrenous with
    memories of cancelled malice. They suspect hero-worship; it
    smacks to them of sentiment. They examine, but never praise.
    Being incapable of sacrifice, they find something
    meretriciously melodramatic about men and nations who are
    capable. Had they lived nineteen hundred
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
       id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span> years ago, they would have
       haunted Calvary to discover fraud.</p>

    <p>Then, there are others, by far more dangerous. These make
    their appearance daily in the morning press, thrusting their
    pessimisms across our breakfast tables, beleaguering our faith
    with ill-natured judgements and querulous warnings. One of our
    London Dailies, for instance, specializes in annoying America;
    it works as effectively to breed distrust as if its policy were
    dictated from Berlin.</p>

    <p>I have just returned from a prolonged tour of America's
    activities in France. Wherever I went I heard nothing but
    unstinted appreciation of Great Britain's surpassing gallantry:
    "We never knew that you Britishers were what you are; you never
    told us. We had to come over here to find out." When that had
    been said I always waited, for I guessed the qualifying
    statement that would follow: "There's only one thing that makes
    us mad. Why the devil does your censor allow the
    P&mdash;&mdash; to sneer at us every morning? Your army doesn't
    feel that way towards us; at least, if it ever did, it doesn't
    now. Are there really people in England who&mdash;?"</p>

    <p>At this point I would cut my questioner short: "There are
    men so short-sighted in every country that, to warm their
    hands, they would burn <span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
       id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span> the crown of thorns. You have
       them in America. Such men are not representative."</p>

    <p>The purpose of this book is to tell what America has done,
    is doing, and, on the strength of her splendid and accomplished
    facts, to plead for a closer friendship between my two
    countries. As an Englishman who has lived in the States for ten
    years and is serving with the Canadian Forces, I feel that I
    have a sympathetic understanding of the affections and
    aloofnesses of both nations; as a member of both families I
    claim the domestic right of indulging in a little plain
    speaking to each in turn.</p>

    <p>In my appeal I leave the fighting men out of the question.
    Death is a universal teacher of charity. At the end of the war
    the men who survive will acknowledge no kinship save the
    kinship of courage. To have answered the call of duty and to
    have played the man, will make a closer bond than having been
    born of the same mother. At a New York theatre last October I
    met some French officers who had fought on the right of the
    Canadian Corps frontage at the Somme. We got to talking,
    commenced remembering, missed the entire performance and parted
    as old friends. In France I stayed with an American-Irish
    Division. They were for the most part American citizens in the
    second generation: few <span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"
       id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span> of them had been to Ireland.
       As frequently happens, they were more Irish than the Irish.
       They had learned from their parents the abuses which had
       driven them to emigrate, but had no knowledge of the
       reciprocal provocations which had caused the abuses.
       Consequently, when they sailed on their troop-ships for
       France they were anti-British almost to a man&mdash;many of
       them were theoretically Sinn Feiners. They were coming to
       fight for France and for Lafayette, who had helped to lick
       Britain&mdash;but not for the British. By the time I met
       them they were marvellously changed. They were going into
       the line almost any day and&mdash;this was what had worked
       the change&mdash;they had been trained for their ordeal by
       British N.C.O.'s and officers. They had swamped their hatred
       and inherited bitterness in admiration. Their highest hope
       was that they might do as well as the British. "They're men
       if you like," they said. In the imminence of death, their
       feeling for these old-timers, who had faced death so often,
       amounted to hero-worship. It was good to hear them deriding
       the caricature of the typical Briton, which had served in
       their mental galleries as an exact likeness for so many
       years. It was proof to me that men who have endured the same
       hell in a common cause will be nearer in spirit, when the
       war is ended, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
       id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span> than they are to their own
       civilian populations. For in all belligerent countries there
       are two armies fighting&mdash;the military and the civilian;
       either can let the other down. If the civilian army loses
       its <i>morale</i>, its vision, its unselfishness, and allows
       itself to be out-bluffed by the civilian army of Germany, it
       as surely betrays its soldiers as if it joined forces with
       the Hun. We execute soldiers for cowardice; it's a pity that
       the same law does not govern the civilian army. There would
       be a rapid revision in the tone of more than one English and
       American newspaper. A soldier is shot for cowardice because
       his example is contagious. What can be more contagious than
       a panic statement or a doubt daily reiterated? Already there
       are many of us who have a kindlier feeling and certainly
       more respect for a Boche who fights gamely, than for a
       Britisher or American who bickers and sulks in comfort. Only
       one doubt as to ultimate victory ever assails the Western
       Front: that it may be attacked in the rear by the premature
       peace negotiations of the civil populations it defends.
       Should that ever happen, the Western Front would cease to be
       a mixture of French, Americans, Canadians, Australians,
       British and Belgians; it would become a nation by itself,
       pledged to fight on till the ideals for which it set out to
       fight are definitely
       established.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
       id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>

    <p>We get rather tired of reading speeches in which civilians
    presume that the making of peace is in their hands. The making
    may be, but the acceptance is in ours. I do not mean that we
    love war for war's sake. We love it rather less than the
    civilian does. When an honourable peace has been confirmed,
    there will be no stauncher pacifist than the soldier; but we
    reserve our pacifism till the war is won. We shall be the last
    people in Europe to get war-weary. We started with a
    vision&mdash;the achieving of justice; we shall not grow weary
    till that vision has become a reality. When one has faced up to
    an ultimate self-denial, giving becomes a habit. One becomes
    eager to be allowed to give all&mdash;to keep none of life's
    small change. The fury of an ideal enfevers us. We become
    fanatical to outdo our own best record in self-surrender. Many
    of us, if we are alive when peace is declared, will feel an
    uneasy reproach that perhaps we did not give enough.</p>

    <p>This being the spirit of our soldiers, it is easy to
    understand their contempt for those civilians who go on strike,
    prate of weariness, scream their terror when a few Hun planes
    sail over London, devote columns in their papers to pin-prick
    tragedies of food-shortage, and cloud the growing generosity
    between England and America by cavilling
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
       id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span> criticisms and mean
       reflections. Their contempt is not that of the fighter for
       the man of peace; but the scorn of the man who is doing his
       duty for the shirker.</p>

    <p>A Tommy is reading a paper in a muddy trench. Suddenly he
    scowls, laughs rather fiercely and calls to his pal, jerking
    his head as a sign to him to hurry. "'Ere Bill, listen to wot
    this 'ere cry-baby says. 'E thinks we're losin' the bloomin'
    war 'cause 'e didn't get an egg for breakfast. Losin' the war!
    A lot 'e knows abart it. A blinkin' lot 'e's done either to win
    or lose it. Yus, I don't think! Thank Gawd, we've none of 'is
    sort up front."</p>

    <p>To men who have gazed for months with the eyes of
    visionaries on sudden death, it comes as a shock to discover
    that back there, where life is so sweetly certain, fear still
    strides unabashed. They had thought that fear was
    dead&mdash;stifled by heroism. They had believed that personal
    littleness had given way before the magnanimity of
    martyrdom.</p>

    <p>In this plea, then, for a firmer Anglo-American friendship I
    address the civilian populations of both countries. The fate of
    such a friendship is in their hands. In the Eden of national
    destinies God is walking; yet there are those who bray their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
       id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span> ancient grievances so loudly
       that they all but drown the sound of His footsteps.</p>

    <p>Being an Englishman it will be more courteous to commence
    with the fools of my own flesh and blood. Let me paint a
    contrast.</p>

    <p>Last October I sailed back from New York with a company of
    American officers; they consisted in the main of trained
    airmen, Navy experts and engineers. Before my departure the
    extraordinary sternness of America, her keenness to rival her
    allies in self-denial, her willing mobilisation of all her
    resources, had confirmed my optimism gained in the trenches,
    that the Allies must win; the mere thought of compromise was
    impossible and blasphemous. This optimism was enhanced on the
    voyage by the conduct of the officers who were my companions.
    They carried their spirit of dedication to an excess that was
    almost irksome. They refused to play cards. They were
    determined not to relax. Every minute they could snatch was
    spent in studying text-books. Their country had come into the
    war so late that they resented any moment lost from making
    themselves proficient. When expostulated with they explained
    themselves by saying, "When we've done our bit it will be time
    to amuse ourselves." They were dull company, but, in a time of
    war, inspiring. All their talk was of when
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"
       id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span> they reached England. Their
       enthusiasm for the Britisher was such that they expected to
       be swept into a rarer atmosphere by the closer contact with
       heroism.</p>

    <p>We had an Englishman with us&mdash;obviously a consumptive.
    He typified for them the doggedness of British pluck. He had
    been through the entire song and dance of the Mexican
    Revolution; a dozen times he had been lined up against a wall
    to be shot. From Mexico he had escaped to New York, hoping to
    be accepted by the British military authorities. Not
    unnaturally he had been rejected. The purpose of his voyage to
    the Old Country was to try his luck with the Navy. He held his
    certificate as a highly qualified marine engineer. No one could
    persuade him that he was not wanted. "I could last six months,"
    he said, "it would be something. Heaps of chaps don't last as
    long."</p>

    <p>This man, a crock in every sense, hurrying back to help his
    country, symbolised for every American aboard the unconquerable
    courage of Great Britain. If you hadn't the full measure of
    years to give, give what was left, even though it were but six
    months. I may add that in England his services were accepted.
    His persistence refused to be disregarded. When red-tape
    stopped his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
       id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span> progress, he used back-stairs
       strategy. No one could bar him from his chance of
       serving.</p>

    <p>In believing that he represented the Empire at its best, my
    Americans were not mistaken. There are thousands fighting
    to-day who share his example. One is an ex-champion sculler of
    Oxford; even in those days he was blind as a bat. His
    subsequent performance is consistent with his record; we always
    knew that he had guts. At the start of the war, he tried to
    enlist and was turned down on the score of eyesight. He tried
    four times with no better result. The fifth time he presented
    himself he was fool-proof; he had learnt the eyesight tests by
    heart. He went out a year ago as a "one pip artist"&mdash;a
    second lieutenant. Within ten months he had become a captain
    and was acting lieutenant-colonel of his battalion, all the
    other officers having been killed or wounded. At Cambrai he did
    such gallant work that he was personally congratulated by the
    general of his division. These American officers had heard such
    stories; they regarded England with a kind of worship. As men
    who hoped to be brave but were untested, they found something
    mystic and well-nigh incredible in such utter courage. The
    consumptive racing across the Atlantic that he might do
    something for England <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"
       id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span> before death took him, made
       this spirit real to them.</p>

    <p>We travelled to London as a party and there for a time we
    held together. The night before several set out for France, we
    had a farewell gathering. The consumptive, who had just
    obtained his commission, was in particularly high feather; he
    brought with him a friend, a civilian official in the Foreign
    Office. Please picture the group: all men who had come from
    distant parts of the world to do one job; men in the army,
    navy, and flying service; every one in uniform except the
    stranger.</p>

    <p>Talk developed along the line of our absolute certainty as
    to complete and final victory. The civilian stranger commenced
    to raise his voice in dissent. We disputed his statements. He
    then set to work to run through the entire argument of
    pessimism: America was too far away to be effective; Russia was
    collapsing; France was exhausted; England had reached the
    zenith of her endeavour; Italy was not united in purpose. On
    every front he saw a black cloud rising and took a dyspeptic's
    delight in describing it as a little blacker than he saw it.
    There was an apostolic zeal about the man's dreary earnestness.
    He spoke with that air of authority which is not uncommon with
    civilian Government officials. The Americans
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
       id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span> stared rather than listened;
       this was not the mystic and utter courage which they had
       expected to find well-nigh incredible. Their own passion far
       out-topped it.</p>

    <p>The argument reached a sudden climax. There were wounded
    officers present. One of them said, "You wouldn't speak that
    way if you had the foggiest conception of the kind of chaps we
    have in the trenches."</p>

    <p>"It makes no difference what kind they are," the pessimist
    replied intolerantly. "I'm asking you to face facts. Because
    you've succeeded in an attack, you soldiers seem to think that
    the war is ended. You base your arguments all the time on your
    little local knowledge of your own particular front."</p>

    <p>The discussion ceased abruptly. Every one sprang up. Voices
    strove together in advising this "facer of facts" to get into
    khaki and to go to where he could obtain precisely the same
    kind of little local knowledge&mdash;perhaps, a few wounds as
    well. His presence was dishonourable&mdash;contaminating. We
    filed out and left him sitting humped in a chair, looking
    puzzled and pathetic, murmuring, "But I thought I was among
    friends."</p>

    <p>My last clear-cut recollection is of a chubby young American
    Naval Airman standing over
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
       id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span> him, with clenched fists,
       passionately instructing him in the spiritual geography of
       America. That's one type of fool; the type who specialises
       in catastrophe; the type who in eternally facing up to
       facts, takes no account of that magic quality, courage,
       which can make one man more terrible than an army; the type
       who is so profoundly well-informed, about externals, that he
       ignores the mightiness of soul that can remould externals to
       spiritual purposes. Were I a German, the spectacle of that
       solitary consumptive leaving the climate which meant life to
       him and hastening home to give just six months of service to
       his country, would be more menacing than the loss of an
       entire corps frontage.</p>

    <p>And there's the type who can't forget; he suffers from a
    fundamental lack of generosity. The Englishman of this type
    can't refrain from quoting such phrases as, "Too proud to
    fight," whenever opportunity offers. His American counterpart
    insists that he is not fighting for Great Britain, but for the
    French. He makes himself offensive by silly talk about sister
    republics, implying that all other forms of Government are
    essentially tyrannic. He never loses an opportunity to mention
    Lafayette, assuming that one French man is worth ten
    Britishers. A very gross falsehood is frequently on the lips of
    this sort of man; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"
       id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span> he doesn't know where he
       picked it up and has never troubled to test its accuracy. I
       can tell him where it originated; at Berlin in the bureau
       for Hun propaganda. Every time he utters it he is helping
       the enemy. This falsehood is to the effect that Great
       Britain has conserved her man-power; that in the early days
       she let Frenchmen do the fighting and that now she is
       marking time till Americans are ready to die in her stead.
       This statement is so stupendously untrue that it goes
       unheeded by those who know the empty homes of England or
       have witnessed the gallantry of our piled-up dead.</p>

    <p>Then there's the jealous fool&mdash;the fool who in England
    will see no reason why this book should have been published.
    His line of argument will be, "We've been in this war for more
    than three years. We've done everything that America is doing;
    because she's new to the game, we're doing it much better. We
    don't want any one to appreciate us, so why go praising her?"
    Precisely. Why be decent? Why seek out affections? Why be
    polite or kindly? Why not be automatons? I suppose the answer
    is, "Because we happen to be men, and are privileged
    temporarily to be playing in the rôle of heroes. The heroic
    spirit rather educates one to hold out the hand of friendship
    to new arrivals of the same
    sort."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
       id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>

    <p>There is one type of fool, exclusively American, whose
    stupidity arises from love and tenderness. Very often she is a
    woman. She has been responsible for the arrival in France of a
    number of narrow-minded and well-intentioned persons; their
    errand is to investigate vice-conditions in the U.S. Army. This
    suspicion of the women at home concerning the conduct of their
    men in the field, is directly traceable to reports of the
    debasing influences of war set in circulation by the
    anti-militarists. I want to say emphatically that cleaner, more
    earnest, better protected troops than those from the United
    States are not to be found in Europe. Both in Great Britain and
    on the Continent their puritanism has created a deep
    impression. By their idealism they have made their power felt;
    they are men with a vision in their eyes, who have travelled
    three thousand miles to keep a rendezvous with death. That
    those for whom they are prepared to die should suspect them is
    a degrading disloyalty. That trackers should be sent after them
    from home to pick up clues to their unworthiness is sheerly
    damnable. To disparage the heroism of other nations is bad
    enough; to distrust the heroes of your own flesh and blood,
    attributing to them lower than civilian moral standards, is to
    be guilty of the meanest treachery and
    ingratitude.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
       id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span>

    <p>Here, then, are some of the sample fools to whom this
    preface is addressed. The list could be indefinitely
    lengthened. "The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no
    God'." He says it in many ways and takes a long while in saying
    it; but the denying of God is usually the beginning and the end
    of his conversation. He denies the vision of God in his
    fellow-men and fellow-nations, even when the spikes of the
    cross are visibly tearing wounds in their feet and hands.</p>

    <p>Life has swung back to a primitive decision since the war
    commenced. The decision is the same for both men and nations.
    They can choose the world or achieve their own souls. They can
    cast mercenary lots for the raiment of a crucified
    righteousness or take up their martyrdom as disciples. Those
    men and nations who have been disciples together can scarcely
    fail to remain friends when the tragedy is ended. What the fool
    says in his heart at this present is not of any lasting
    importance. There will always be those who mock, offering
    vinegar in the hour of agony and taunting, "If thou be what
    thou sayest...." But in the comradeship of the twilit walk to
    Emmaus neither the fool nor the mocker are
    remembered.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"

    <h2>OUT TO WIN</h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
       id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>

    <h2>I</h2>

    <h2>"WE'VE GOT FOUR YEARS"</h2>

    <p>The American Troops have set words to one of their bugle
    calls. These words are indicative of their spirit&mdash;of the
    calculated determination with which they have faced up to their
    adventure: an adventure unparalleled for magnitude in the
    history of their nation.</p>

    <p>They fall in in two ranks. They tell off from the right in
    fours. "Move to the right in fours. Quick March," comes the
    order. The bugles strike up. The men swing into column
    formation, heads erect and picking up the step. To the song of
    the bugles they chant words as they march. "We've got four
    years to do this job. We've got four years to do this job."</p>

    <p>That is the spirit of America. Her soldiers give her four
    years, but to judge from the scale of her preparations she
    might be planning for thirty.</p>

    <p>America is out to win. I write this opening sentence in
    Paris where I am temporarily absent
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"
       id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span> from my battery, that I may
       record the story of America's efforts in France. My purpose
       is to prove with facts that America is in the war to her
       last dollar, her last man, and for just as long as Germany
       remains unrepentant. Her strength is unexpended, her spirit
       is un-war-weary. She has a greater efficient man-power for
       her population than any nation that has yet entered the
       arena of hostilities. Her resources are continental rather
       than national; it is as though a new and undivided Europe
       had sprung to arms in moral horror against Germany. She has
       this to add fierceness to her soul&mdash;the reproach that
       she came in too late. That reproach is being wiped out
       rapidly by the scarlet of self-imposed sacrifice. She did
       come in late&mdash;for that very reason she will be the last
       of Germany's adversaries to withdraw.</p>

    <p>She did not want to come in at all. Many of her hundred
    million population emigrated to her shores out of hatred of
    militarism and to escape from just such a hell as is now raging
    in Europe. At first it seemed a far cry from Flanders to San
    Francisco. Philanthropy could stretch that far, but not the
    risking of human lives. Moreover, the American nation is not
    racially a unit; it is bound together by its ideal quest for
    peaceful and democratic institutions. It was a difficult task
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"
       id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span> for any government to
       convince so remote a people that their destiny was being
       made molten in the furnace of the Western Front; when once
       that truth was fully apprehended the diverse souls of
       America leapt up as one soul and declared for war. In so
       doing the people of the United States forewent the freedom
       from fear that they had gained by their journey across the
       Atlantic; they turned back in their tracks to smite again
       with renewed strength and redoubled hate the old brutal
       Fee-Fo-Fum of despotism, from whose clutches they thought
       they had escaped.</p>

    <p>America's is the case of The Terrible Meek; for two and a
    half years she lulled Germany and astonished the Allies by her
    abnormal patience. The most terrifying warriors of history have
    been peace-loving nations hounded into hostility by outraged
    ideals. Certainly no nation was ever more peace-loving than the
    American. To the boy of the Middle West the fury of kings must
    have read like a fairy-tale. The appeal to armed force was a
    method of compelling righteousness which his entire training
    had taught him to view with contempt as obsolete. Yet never has
    any nation mobilised its resources more efficiently, on so
    titanic a scale, in so brief a space of time to re-establish
    justice with armed force. The outraged ideal which achieved
    this miracle was the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"
       id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span> denial by the Hun of the
       right of every man to personal liberty and happiness.</p>

    <p>Few people guessed that America would fling her weight so
    utterly into the winning of the Allied cause. Those who knew
    her best thought it scarcely possible. Germany, who believed
    she knew her, thought it least of all. German statesmen argued
    that America had too much to lose by such a decision&mdash;too
    little to gain; the task of transporting men and materials
    across three thousand miles of ocean seemed insuperable; the
    differing traditions of her population would make it impossible
    for her to concentrate her will in so unusual a direction.
    Basing their arguments on a knowledge of the deep-seated
    selfishness of human nature, Hun statesmen were of the fixed
    opinion that no amount of insult would compel America to take
    up the sword.</p>

    <p>Two and a half years before, those same statesmen made the
    same mistake with regard to Great Britain and her Dominions.
    The British were a race of shop-keepers; no matter how
    chivalrous the call, nothing would persuade them to jeopardise
    their money-bags. If they did for once leap across their
    counters to become Sir Galahads, then the Dominions would seize
    that opportunity to secure their own base safety and to fling
    the Mother Country out of doors. The British gave
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"
       id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span> these students of selfishness
       a surprise from which their military machine has never
       recovered, when the "Old Contemptibles" held up the advance
       of the Hun legions and won for Europe a breathing-space. The
       Dominions gave them a second lesson in magnanimity when
       Canada's lads built a wall with their bodies to block the
       drive at Ypres. America refuted them for the third time,
       when she proved her love of world-liberty greater than her
       affection for the dollar, bugling across the Atlantic her
       shrill challenge to mailed bestiality. Germany has made the
       grave mistake of estimating human nature at its lowest worth
       as she sees it reflected in her own face. In every case, in
       her judgment of the two great Anglo-Saxon races, she has
       been at fault through over-emphasising their capacity for
       baseness and under-estimating their capacity to respond to
       an ideal. It was an ideal that led the Pilgrim Fathers
       westward; after more than two hundred years it is an ideal
       which pilots their sons home again, racing through danger
       zones in their steel-built greyhounds that they may lay down
       their lives in France.</p>

    <p>In view of the monumental stupidity of her diplomacy Germany
    has found it necessary to invent explanations. The form these
    have taken as regards America has been the attributing of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"
       id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span> fresh low motives. Her object
       at first was to prove to the world at large how very little
       difference America's participation in hostilities would
       make. When America tacitly negatived this theory by the
       energy with which she raised billions and mobilised her
       industries, Hun propagandists, by an ingenious casuistry,
       spread abroad the opinion that these mighty preparations
       were a colossal bluff which would redound to Germany's
       advantage. They said that President Wilson had bided his
       time so that his country might strut as a belligerent for
       only the last six months, and so obtain a voice in the peace
       negotiations. He did not intend that America should fight,
       and was only getting his armies ready that they might
       enforce peace when the Allies were exhausted and already
       counting on Americans manning their trenches. Inasmuch as
       his country would neither have sacrificed nor died, he would
       be willing to give Germany better terms; therefore America's
       apparent joining of the Allies was a camouflage which would
       turn out an advantage to Germany. This lie, with variations,
       has spread beyond the Rhine and gained currency in certain
       of the neutral nations.</p>

    <p>Four days after President Wilson's declaration of war the
    Canadians captured Vimy Ridge. As the Hun prisoners came
    running like scared rabbits
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
       id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span> through the shell-fire, we
       used to question them as to conditions on their side of the
       line. Almost the first question that was asked was, "What do
       you think about the United States?" By far the most frequent
       reply was, "We have submarines; the United States will make
       no difference." The answer was so often in the same formula
       that it was evident the men had been schooled in the
       opinion. It was only the rare man of education who said, "It
       is bad&mdash;very bad; the worst mistake we have made."</p>

    <p>We, in the front-line, were very far from appreciating
    America's decision at its full value. For a year we had had the
    upper-hand of the Hun. To use the language of the trenches, we
    knew that we could go across No Man's Land and "beat him up"
    any time we liked. To tell the truth, many of us felt a little
    jealous that when, after two years of punishment, we had at
    last become top-dog, we should be called upon to share the
    glory of victory with soldiers of the eleventh hour. We
    believed that we were entirely capable of finishing the job
    without further aid. My own feeling, as an Englishman living in
    New York, was merely one of relief&mdash;that now, when war was
    ended, I should be able to return to friends of whom I need not
    be ashamed. To what extent America's earnestness has changed
    that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
       id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span> sentiment is shown by the
       expressed desire of every Canadian, that if Americans are
       anywhere on the Western Front, they ought to be next to us
       in the line. "They are of our blood," we say; "they will
       carry on our record." Only those who have had the honour to
       serve with the Canadian Corps and know its dogged adhesion
       to heroic traditions, can estimate the value of this
       compliment.</p>

    <p>I should say that in the eyes of the combatant, after
    President Wilson, Mr. Ford has done more than any other one man
    to interpret the spirit of his nation; our altered attitude
    towards him typifies our altered attitude towards America. Mr.
    Ford, the impassioned pacifist, sailing to Europe in his ark of
    peace, staggered our amazement. Mr. Ford, still the impassioned
    pacifist, whose aeroplane engines will help to bomb the Hun's
    conscience into wakefulness, staggers our amazement but
    commands our admiration. We do not attempt to understand or
    reconcile his two extremes of conduct, but as fighters we
    appreciate the courage of soul that made him "about turn" to
    search for his ideal in a painful direction when the old
    friendly direction had failed. Here again it is significant
    that both with regard to individuals and nations, Germany's
    sternest foes are war-haters&mdash;war-haters to such an extent
    that their <span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"
       id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span> principles at times have
       almost shipwrecked their careers. In England our example is
       Lloyd George. Throughout the Anglo-Saxon world the
       slumbering spirit of Cromwell's Ironsides has sprung to
       life, reminding the British Empire and the United States of
       their common ancestry. After a hundred and forty years of
       drifting apart, we stand side by side like our forefathers,
       the fighting pacifists at Naseby; like them, having failed
       to make men good with words, we will hew them into virtue
       with the sword.</p>

    <p>At the end of June I went back to Blighty wounded. One of my
    most vivid recollections of the time that followed is an early
    morning in July; it must have been among the first of the days
    that I was allowed out of hospital. London was green and leafy.
    The tracks of the tramways shone like silver in the sunlight.
    There was a spirit of release and immense good humour abroad.
    My course followed the river on the south side, all a-dance
    with wind and little waves. As I crossed the bridge at
    Westminster I became aware of an atmosphere of expectation.
    Subconsciously I must have been noticing it for some time.
    Along Whitehall the pavements were lined with people, craning
    their necks, joking and jostling, each trying to better his
    place. Trafalgar Square was jammed with a dense mass of
    humanity, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"
       id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span> through which mounted police
       pushed their way solemnly, like beadles in a vast unroofed
       cathedral. Then for the first time I noticed what I ought to
       have noticed long before, that the Stars and Stripes were
       exceptionally prevalent. Upon inquiry I was informed that
       this was the day on which the first of the American troops
       were to march. I picked up with a young officer or the
       Dublin Fusiliers and together we forced our way down Pall
       Mall to the office of The Cecil Rhodes Oxford Scholars'
       Foundation. From here we could watch the line of march from
       Trafalgar Square to Marlborough House. While we waited, I
       scanned the group-photographs on the walls, some of which
       contained portraits of German Rhodes Scholars with whom I
       had been acquainted. I remembered how they had always spent
       their vacations in England, assiduously bicycling to the
       most unexpected places. In the light of later developments I
       thought I knew the reason.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, far away bands struck up. We thronged the windows,
    leaning out that we might miss nothing. Through the half mile
    of people that stretched between us and the music a shudder of
    excitement was running. Then came cheers&mdash;the
    deep-throated babel of men's voices and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
       id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span> shrill staccato of women's.
       "They're coming," some one cried; then I saw them.</p>

    <p>I forget which regiment lead. The Coldstreams were there,
    the Scotch and Welsh Guards, the Irish Guards with their
    saffron kilts and green ribbons floating from their bag-pipes.
    A British regimental band marched ahead of each American
    regiment to do it honour. Down the sunlit canyon of Pall Mall
    they swung to the tremendous cheering of the crowd. Quite
    respectable citizens had climbed lamp-posts and railings, and
    were waving their hats. I caught the words that were being
    shouted, "Are we downhearted?" Then, in a fierce roar of
    denial, "No!" It was a wonderful ovation&mdash;far more
    wonderful than might have been expected from a people who had
    grown accustomed to the sight of troops during the last three
    years. The genuineness of the welcome was patent; it was the
    voice of England that was thundering along the pavements.</p>

    <p>I was anxious to see the quality of the men which America
    had sent. They drew near; then I saw them plainly. They were
    fine strapping chaps, broad of shoulder and proudly
    independent. They were not soldiers yet; they were civilians
    who had been rushed into khaki. Their equipment was of every
    kind and sort and spoke eloquently of the hurry in which they
    had been <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"
       id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span> brought together. That meant
       much to us in London-much more than if they had paraded with
       all the "spit and polish" of the crack troops who led them.
       It meant to us that America was doing her bit at the
       earliest date possible.</p>

    <p>The other day, here in France, I met an officer of one of
    those battalions; he told me the Americans' side of the story.
    They were expert railroad troops, picked out of civilian life
    and packed off to England without any pretence at military
    training. When they were informed that they were to be the
    leading feature in a London procession, many of them even
    lacked uniforms. With true American democracy of spirit, the
    officers stripped their rank-badges from their spare tunics and
    lent them to the privates, who otherwise could not have
    marched.</p>

    <p>"I'm satisfied," my friend said, "that there were Londoners
    so doggone hoarse that night that they couldn't so much as
    whisper."</p>

    <p>What impressed the men most of all was the King's friendly
    greeting of them at Buckingham Palace. There were few of them
    who had ever seen a king before. "Friendly&mdash;that's the
    word! From the King downwards they were all so friendly. It was
    more like a family party than a procession; and on the return
    journey, when we marched at ease, old ladies broke up our
    formations <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
       id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span> to kiss us. Nice and
       grandmotherly of them we thought."</p>

    <p>This, as I say, I learnt later in France; at the time I only
    knew that the advance-guard of millions was marching. As I
    watched them my eyes grew misty. Troops who have already fought
    no longer stir me; they have exchanged their dreams of glory
    for the reality of sacrifice&mdash;they know to what they may
    look forward. But untried troops have yet to be disillusioned;
    dreams of the pomp of war are still in their eyes. They have
    not yet owned that they are merely going out to die
    obscurely.</p>

    <p>That day made history. It was then that England first
    vividly realised that America was actually standing shoulder to
    shoulder at her side. In making history it obliterated almost a
    century and a half of misunderstanding. I believe I am correct
    in saying that the last foreign troops to march through London
    were the Hessians, who fought against America in the
    Revolution, and that never before had foreign volunteers
    marched through England save as conquerors.</p>

    <p>On my recovery I was sent home on sick leave and spent a
    month in New York. No one who has not been there since America
    joined the Allies can at all realise the change that has taken
    place. It is a change of soul, which no statistics
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"
       id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span> of armaments can photograph.
       America has come into the war not only with her factories,
       her billions and her man-power, but with her heart shining
       in her eyes. All her spread-eagleism is gone. All her
       aggressive industrial ruthlessness has vanished. With these
       has been lost her youthful contempt for older civilisations,
       whom she was apt to regard as decaying because they sent her
       emigrants. She has exchanged her prejudices for admiration
       and her grievances for kindness. Her "Hats off" attitude to
       France, England, Belgium and to every nation that has shed
       blood for the cause which now is hers, was a thing which I
       had scarcely expected; it was amazing. As an example of how
       this attitude is being interpreted into action,
       school-histories throughout the United States are being
       re-written, so that American children of the future may be
       trained in friendship for Great Britain, whereas formerly
       stress was laid on the hostilities of the eighteenth century
       which produced the separation. As a further example, many
       American boys, who for various reasons were not accepted by
       the military authorities in their own country, have gone up
       to Canada to join.</p>

    <p>One such case is typical. Directly it became evident that
    America was going into the war, one boy, with whom I am
    acquainted, made up his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
       id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> mind to be prepared to join.
       He persuaded his father to allow him to go to a Flying
       School to train as a pilot. Having obtained his certificate,
       he presented himself for enlistment and was turned down on
       the ground that he was lacking in a sense of equipoise.
       Being too young for any other branch of the service, he
       persuaded his family to allow him to try his luck in Canada.
       Somehow, by hook or by crook, he had to get into the war.
       The Royal Flying Corps accepted him with the proviso that he
       must take out his British naturalisation papers. This
       changing of nationality was a most bitter pill for his
       family to swallow. The boy had done his best to be a
       soldier; he was the eldest son, and there they would
       willingly have had the matter rest. Moreover they could
       compel the matter to rest there, for, being under age, he
       could not change his nationality without his father's
       consent. It was his last desperate argument that turned the
       decision in his favour, "If it's a choice between my honour
       and my country, I choose my honour every time." So now he's
       a Britisher, learning "spit and polish" and expecting to
       bring down a Hun almost any day.</p>

    <p>One noticed in almost the smallest details how deeply
    America had committed her conscience to her new undertaking.
    While in England we grumble about a food-control which is
    absolutely <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"
       id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span> necessary to our
       preservation, America is voluntarily restricting herself not
       for her own sake, but for the sake of the Allies. They say
       that they are being "Hooverized," thus coining a new word
       out of Mr. Hoover's name. Sometimes these Hooverish
       practices produce contrasts which are rather quaint. I went
       to stay with a friend who had just completed as his home an
       exact reproduction of a palace in Florence. Whoever went
       short, there was little that he could not afford. At our
       meals I noticed that I was the only person who was served
       with butter and sugar, and enquired why. "It's all right for
       you," I was told; "you're a soldier; but if we eat butter
       and sugar, some of the Allies who really need them will have
       to go short." A small illustration, but one that is typical
       of a national, sacrificial, underlying thought.</p>

    <p>Later I met with many instances of the various forms in
    which this thought is taking shape. I was in America when the
    Liberty War Loan was so amazingly over-subscribed. I saw buses,
    their roofs crowded with bands and orators, doing the tour of
    street-corners. Every store of any size, every railroad, every
    bank and financial corporation had set for its employés and
    customers the ideal sum which it considered that they
    personally ought to subscribe. This ideal sum was recorded
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
       id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> on the face of a clock, hung
       outside the building. As the gross amount actually collected
       increased, the hands were seen to revolve. Everything that
       eloquence and ingenuity could devise was done to gather
       funds for the war. Big advertisers made a gift of their
       newspaper space to the nation. There were certain
       public-spirited men who took up blocks of war-bonds, making
       the request that no interest should be paid. You went to a
       theatre; during the interval actors and actresses sold
       war-certificates, harangued the audience and set the example
       by their own purchases.</p>

    <p>When the Liberty War Loan had been raised, the Red Cross
    started its great national drive, apportioning the necessary
    grand total among all the cities from sea-board to sea-board,
    according to their wealth and population.</p>

    <p>One heard endless stories of the variety of efforts being
    made. America had committed her heart to the Allies with an
    abandon which it is difficult to describe. Young society girls,
    who had been brought up in luxury and protected from ugliness
    all their lives, were banding themselves into units, supplying
    the money, hiring the experts, and coming over themselves to
    France to look after refugees' babies. Others were planning to
    do reconstruction work in the devastated districts immediately
    behind the battle-line. I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"
       id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span> met a number of these
       enthusiasts before they sailed; I have since seen them at
       work in France. What struck me at the time was their
       rose-leaf frailness and utter unsuitability for the task. I
       could guess the romantic visions which tinted their souls to
       the colour of sacrifice; I also knew what refugees and
       devastated districts look like. I feared that the
       discrepancy between the dream and the reality would doom
       them to disillusion.</p>

    <p>During the month that I was in America I visited several of
    the camps. The first draft army had been called. The first call
    gave the country seven million men from which to select. I was
    surprised to find that in many camps, before military training
    could commence, schools in English had to be started to ensure
    the men's proper understanding of commands. This threw a new
    light on the difficulties Mr. Wilson had had to face in coming
    into the war.</p>

    <p>The men of the draft army represent as many nationalities,
    dialects and race-prejudices as there are in Europe. They are a
    Europe expatriated. During their residence in America a great
    many of them have lived in communities where their own language
    is spoken, and their own customs are maintained. Frequently
    they have their own newspapers, which foster their national
    exclusiveness, and reflect the hatreds and affections of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"
       id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span> country from which they
       emigrated. These conditions set up a barrier between them
       and current American opinion which it was difficult for the
       authorities at Washington to cross. The people who
       represented neutral European nations naturally were anxious
       for the neutrality of America. The people who represented
       the Central Powers naturally were against America siding
       with the Allies. The only way of re-directing their
       sympathies was by means of education and propaganda; this
       took time, especially when they were separated from the
       truth by the stumbling block of language. For three years
       they had to be persuaded that they were no longer Poles,
       Swedes, Germans, Finns, Norwegians, but first and last
       Americans. I mention this here, in connection with the
       teaching of the draft army English, because it affords one
       of the most vivid and comprehensible reasons for America's
       long delay.</p>

    <p>What brought America into the war? I have often been asked
    the question; in answering it I always feel that I am giving
    only a partial answer. On the one hand there is the record of
    her two and a half years of procrastination, on the other the
    titanic upspringing of her warrior-spirit, which happened
    almost in a day. How can one reconcile the multitudinous
    pacific notes which issued from Washington with the bugle-song
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
       id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span> to which the American boys
       march: "We've got four years to do this job." The cleavage
       between the two attitudes is too sharp for the comprehension
       of other nations.</p>

    <p>The first answer which I shall give is entirely sane and
    will be accepted by the rankest cynic. America came into the
    war at the moment she realised that her own national life was
    endangered. Her leaders realised this months before her masses
    could be persuaded. The political machinery of the United
    States is such that no Government would dare to commence
    hostilities unless it was assured that its decision was the
    decision of the entire nation. That the Government might have
    this assurance, Mr. Wilson had to maintain peace long after the
    intellect of America had declared for war, while he educated
    the cosmopolitan citizenship of his country into a knowledge of
    Hun designs. The result was that he created the appearance of
    having been pushed into hostilities by the weight of public
    opinion.</p>

    <p>For many months the Secret Service agents of the States,
    aided by the agents of other nations, were unravelling German
    plots and collecting data of treachery so irrefutable that it
    had to be accepted. When all was ready the first chapters of
    the story were divulged. They were divulged almost in the form
    of a serial novel, so that the man
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"
       id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span> who read his paper to-day and
       said, "No doubt that isolated item is true, but it doesn't
       incriminate the entire German nation," next day on opening
       his paper, found further proof and was forced to retreat to
       more ingenious excuses. One day he was informed of Germany's
       abuse of neutral embassies and mail-bags; the next of the
       submarine bases in Mexico, prepared as a threat against
       American shipping; the day after that the whole infamous
       story of how Berlin had financed the Mexican Revolution.
       Germany's efforts to provoke an American-Japanese war leaked
       out, her attempts to spread disloyalty among
       German-Americans, her conspiracies for setting fire to
       factories and powder-plants, including the blowing up of
       bridges and the Welland Canal. Quietly, circumstantially,
       without rancour, the details were published of the criminal
       spider-web woven by the Dernburgs, Bernstorffs and Von
       Papens, accredited creatures of the Kaiser, who with
       Machiavellian smiles had professed friendship for those whom
       their hands itched to slay and strangle. Gradually the
       camouflage of bovine geniality was lifted from the face of
       Germany and the dripping fangs of the Blonde Beast were
       displayed&mdash;the Minotaur countenance of one glutted with
       human flesh, weary with rape and rapine, but still
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"
       id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span> tragically insatiable and
       lusting for the new sensation of hounding America to
       destruction.</p>

    <p>I have not placed these revelations in their proper
    sequence; some were made after war had been declared. They had
    the effect of changing every decent American into a
    self-appointed detective. The weight of evidence put Germany's
    perfidy beyond dispute; clues to new and endless chains of
    machinations were discovered daily. The Hun had come as a guest
    into America's house with only one intent&mdash;to do murder as
    soon as the lights were out.</p>

    <p>The anger which these disclosures produced knew no bounds.
    Hun apologists&mdash;the type of men who invariably believe
    that there is a good deal to be said on both
    sides&mdash;quickly faded into patriots. There had been those
    who had cried out for America's intervention from the first day
    that Belgium's neutrality had been violated. Many of these,
    losing patience, had either enlisted in Canada or were already
    in France on some errand of mercy. Their cry had reached
    Washington at first only as a whisper, very faint and distant.
    Little by little that cry had swelled, till it became the
    nation's voice, angry, insistent, not to be disregarded. The
    most convinced humanitarian, together with the sincerest
    admirer of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"
       id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span> old-fashioned kindly Hans,
       had to join in that cry or brand himself a traitor by his
       silence.</p>

    <p>America came into the war, as every country came, because
    her life was threatened. She is not fighting for France, Great
    Britain, Belgium, Serbia; she is fighting to save herself. I am
    glad to make this point because I have heard camouflaged
    Pro-Germans and thoughtless mischief-makers discriminating
    between the Allies. "We are not fighting for Great Britain,"
    they say, "but for plucky France." When I was in New York last
    October a firm stand was being made against these
    discriminators; some of them even found themselves in the hands
    of the Secret Service men. The feeling was growing that not to
    be Pro-British was not to be Pro-Ally, and that not to be
    Pro-Ally was to be anti-American. This talk of fighting for
    somebody else is all lofty twaddle. America is fighting for
    America. While the statement is perfectly true, Americans have
    a right to resent it.</p>

    <p>In September, 1914, I crossed to Holland and was immensely
    disgusted at the interpretation of Great Britain's action which
    I found current there. I had supposed that Holland would be
    full of admiration; I found that she was nothing of the sort.
    We Britishers, in those early days, believed that we were
    magnanimous big brothers <span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"
       id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span> who could have kept out of
       the bloodshed, but preferred to die rather than see the
       smaller nations bullied. Men certainly did not join
       Kitchener's mob because they believed that England's life
       was threatened. I don't believe that any strong emotion of
       patriotism animated Canada in her early efforts. The
       individual Briton donned the khaki because he was determined
       to see fair play, and was damned if he would stand by a
       spectator while women and children were being butchered in
       Belgium. He felt that he had to do something to stop it. If
       he didn't, the same thing would happen in Holland, then in
       Denmark, then in Norway. There was no end to it. When a mad
       dog starts running the best thing to do is to shoot it.</p>

    <p>But the Hollanders didn't agree with me at all. "You're
    fighting for yourselves," they said. "You're not fighting to
    save us from being invaded; you're not fighting to prevent the
    Hun from conquering France; you're not fighting to liberate
    Belgium. You're fighting because you know that if you let
    France be crushed, it will be your turn next."</p>

    <p>Quite true&mdash;and absolutely unjust. The Hollander, whose
    households we were guarding, chose to interpret our motive at
    its most ignoble worth. Our men were receiving in their bodies
    the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
       id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span> wounds which would have been
       inflicted on Holland, had we elected to stand out. In the
       light of subsequent events, all the world acknowledges that
       we were and are fighting for our own households; but it is a
       glorious certainty that scarcely a Britisher who died in
       those early days had the least realisation of the fact. It
       was the chivalrous vision of a generous Crusade that led our
       chaps from their firesides to the trampled horror that is
       Flanders. They said farewell to their habitual affections,
       and went out singing to their marriage with death.</p>

    <p>I suppose there has been no war that could not be
    interpreted ultimately as a war of self-interest. The statesmen
    who make wars always carefully reckon the probabilities of loss
    or gain; but the lads who kiss their sweethearts good-bye
    require reasons more vital than those of pounds, shillings and
    pence. Few men lay down their lives from self-interested
    motives. Courage is a spiritual quality which requires a
    spiritual inducement. Men do not set a price on their chance of
    being blown to bits by shells. Even patriotism is too vague to
    be a sufficient incentive. The justice of the cause to be
    fought for helps; it must be proportionate to the magnitude of
    the sacrifice demanded. But always an ideal is
    necessary&mdash;an ideal of liberty, indignation and mercy. If
    this <span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"
       id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span> is true of the men who go out
       to die, it is even more true of the women who send them,</p>

    <p>For two and a half years the American press specialized on
    the terror aspect of the European hell. Every sensational,
    exceptional fact was not only chronicled, but widely
    circulated. The bodily and mental havoc that can be wrought by
    shell fire was exaggerated out of all proportion to reality.
    Photographs, almost criminal in type, were published to
    illustrate the brutal expression of men who had taken part in
    bayonet charges. Lies were spread broadcast by supposedly
    reputable persons, stating how soldiers had to be maddened
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"
       id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span> with drugs or alcohol before
       they would go over the top. Much of what was recorded was
       calculated to stagger the imagination and intimidate the
       heart. The reason for this was that the supposed
       eye-witnesses rarely saw what they recorded. They had
       usually never been within ten miles of the front, for only
       combatants are allowed in the line. They brought civilian
       minds, undisciplined to the conquest of fear, to their task;
       they never for one instant guessed the truly spiritual
       exaltation which gives wings to the soul of the man who
       fights in a just cause. Squalor, depravity, brutalisation,
       death&mdash;moral, mental and physical deformity were the
       rewards which the American public learned the fighting man
       gained in the trenches. They heard very little of the
       capacity for heroism, the eagerness for sacrifice, the
       gallant self-effacement which having honor for a companion
       taught. And yet, despite this frantic portrayal of terror,
       America decided for war. Her National Guard and Volunteers
       rolled up in millions, clamouring to cross the three
       thousand miles of water that they might place their lives in
       jeopardy. They were no more urged by motives of
       self-interest than were the men who enlisted in Kitchener's
       mob. It wasn't the threat to their national security that
       brought them; it was the lure of an ideal&mdash;the fine
       white <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"
       id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span> knightliness of men whose
       compassion had been tormented and whose manhood had been
       challenged. When one says that America came into the war to
       save herself it is only true of her statesmen; it is no more
       true of her masses than it was true of the masses of Great
       Britain.</p>

    <p>So far, in my explanation as to why America came into the
    war, I have been scarcely more generous in the attributing of
    magnanimous motives than my Hollander. To all intents and
    purposes I have said, "America is fighting because she knows
    that if the Allies are over-weakened or crushed, it will be her
    turn next." In discussing the matter with me, one of our
    Generals said, "I really don't see that it matters a tuppenny
    cuss why she's fighting, so long as she helps us to lick the
    Hun and does it quickly." But it does matter. The reasons for
    her having taken up arms make all the difference to our respect
    for her. Here, then, are the reasons which I attribute:
    enthusiasm for the ideals of the Allies; admiration for the
    persistency of their heroism; compassionate determination to
    borrow some of the wounds which otherwise would be inflicted
    upon nations which have already suffered. A small band of
    pioneers in mercy are directly responsible for this change of
    attitude in two and a half years from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
       id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span> opportunistic neutrality to a
       reckless welcoming of martyrdom.</p>

    <p>At the opening of hostilities in 1914, America divided
    herself into two camps&mdash;the Pro-Allies and the others.
    "The others" consisted of people of all shades of opinion and
    conviction: the anti-British, anti-French, the pro-German, the
    anti-war and the merely neutral, some of whom set feverishly to
    work to make a tradesman's advantage out of Europe's
    misfortune. A great traffic sprang up in the manufacture of war
    materials. Almost all of these went to the Allies, owing to the
    fact that Britain controlled the seas. Whether they would not
    have been sold just as readily to Germany, had that been
    possible, is a matter open to question. In any case, the camp
    of "The Others" was overwhelmingly in the majority.</p>

    <p>One by one, and in little protesting bands, the friends of
    the Allies slipped overseas bound on self-imposed, sacrificial
    quests. They went like knight-errants to the rescue; while
    others suffered, their own ease was intolerable. The women,
    whom they left, formed themselves into groups for the
    manufacture of the munitions of mercy. There were men like Alan
    Seeger, who chanced to be in Europe when war broke out; many of
    these joined up with the nearest fighting
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"
       id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span> units. "I have a rendezvous
       with death," were Alan Seeger's last words as he fell
       mortally wounded between the French and German trenches. His
       voice was the voice of thousands who had pledged themselves
       to keep that rendezvous in the company of Britishers,
       Belgians and Frenchmen, long before their country had dreamt
       of committing herself. Some of these friends of the Allies
       chose the Ford Ambulance, others positions in the Commission
       for the Relief of Belgium, and yet others the more forceful
       sympathy of the bayonet as a means of expressing their
       wrath. Soon, through the heart of France, with the tricolor
       and the Stars and Stripes flying at either end, "le train
       Américaine" was seen hurrying, carrying its scarlet burden.
       This sight could hardly be called neutral unless a similar
       sight could be seen in Germany. It could not. The Commission
       for the Relief of Belgium was actually anything but neutral;
       to minister to the results of brutality is tacitly to
       condemn.</p>

    <p>At Neuilly-sur-Seine the American Ambulance Hospital sprang
    up. It undertook the most grievous cases, making a specialty of
    facial mutilations. American girls performed the nursing of
    these pitiful human wrecks. Increasingly the crusader spirit
    was finding a gallant response in the hearts of America's
    girlhood. By the time that President
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"
       id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span> Wilson flung his challenge,
       eighty-six war relief organizations were operating in
       France. In very many cases these organizations only
       represented a hundredth part of the actual personnel
       working; the other ninety-nine hundredths were in the
       States, rolling bandages, shredding oakum, slitting linen,
       making dressings. Long before April, 1917, American college
       boys had won a name by their devotion in forcing their
       ambulances over shell torn roads on every part of the French
       Front, but, perhaps, with peculiar heroism at Verdun.
       Already the American Flying Squadron has earned a veteran's
       reputation for its daring. The report of the sacrificial
       courage of these pioneers had travelled to every State in
       the Union; their example had stirred, shamed and educated
       the nation. It is to these knight-errants&mdash;very many of
       them boys and girls in years&mdash;to the Mrs. Whartons, the
       Alan Seegers, the Hoovers and the Thaws that I attribute
       America's eager acceptance of Calvary, when at last it was
       offered to her by her Statesmen. From an anguished horror to
       be repelled, war had become a spiritual Eldorado in whose
       heart lay hidden the treasure-trove of national honor.</p>

    <p>The individual American soldier is inspired by just as
    altruistic motives as his brother-Britisher. Compassion,
    indignation, love of justice, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
       id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span> determination to see right
       conquer are his incentives. You can make a man a conscript,
       drill him, dress him in uniform, but you cannot force him to
       face up to four years to do his job unless the ideals were
       there beforehand. I have seen American troop-ships come into
       the dock with ten thousand men singing,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Good-bye, Liza,</p>

            <p>I'm going to smash the Kaiser."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>I have been present when packed audiences have gone mad in
    reiterating the American equivalent for <i>Tipperary</i>, with
    its brave promise,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"We'll be over,</p>

            <p>We're coming over,</p>

            <p>And we won't be back till it's over, over
            there."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>But nothing I have heard so well expresses the cold anger of
    the American fighting-man as these words which they chant to
    their bugle-march, "We've got four years to do this
    job."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"
       id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span>

    <h2>II</h2>

    <h2>WAR AS A JOB</h2>

    <p>I have been so fortunate as to be able to watch three
    separate nations facing up to the splendour of
    Armageddon&mdash;England, France, America. The spirit of each
    was different. I arrived in England from abroad the week after
    war had been declared. There was a new vitality in the air, a
    suppressed excitement, a spirit of youth and&mdash;it sounds
    ridiculous&mdash;of opportunity. The England I had left had
    been wont to go about with a puckered forehead; she was a
    victim of self-disparagement. She was like a mother who had
    borne too many children and was at her wits' end to know how to
    feed or manage them. They were getting beyond her control.
    Since the Boer War there had been a growing tendency in the
    Press to under-rate all English effort and to over-praise to
    England's discredit the superior pushfulness of other nations.
    This melancholy nagging which had for its constant text, "Wake
    up, John Bull," had produced
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"
       id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span> the hallucination that there
       was something vitally the matter with the Mother Country. No
       one seemed to have diagnosed her complaint, but those of us
       who grew weary of being told that we were behind the times,
       took prolonged trips to more cheery quarters of the globe.
       It is the Englishman's privilege to run himself down; he
       usually does it with his tongue in his cheek. But for the
       ten years preceding the outbreak of hostilities, the
       prophets of Fleet Street certainly carried their privilege
       beyond a joke. Pessimism was no longer an amusing pose; it
       was becoming a habit.</p>

    <p>One week of the iron tonic of war had changed all that. The
    atmosphere was as different as the lowlands from the Alps; it
    was an atmosphere of devil-may-care assurance and adventurous
    manhood. Every one had the summer look of a boat-race crowd
    when the Leander is to be pulled off at Henley. In comparing
    the new England with the old, I should have said that every one
    now had the comfortable certainty that he was wanted&mdash;that
    he had a future and something to live for. But it wasn't the
    something to live for that accounted for this gay alertness; it
    was the sure foreknowledge of each least important man that he
    had something worth dying for at last.</p>

    <p>A strange and magnificent way of answering
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"
       id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span> misfortune's
       challenge&mdash;an Elizabethan way, the knack of which we
       believed we had lost! "Business as usual" was written across
       our doorways. It sounded callous and unheeding, but at night
       the lads who had written it there, tiptoed out and stole
       across the Channel, scarcely whispering for fear they should
       break our hearts by their going.</p>

    <p>Death may be regarded as a funeral or as a Columbus
    expedition to worlds unknown&mdash;it may be seized upon as an
    opportunity for weeping or for a display of courage. From the
    first day in her choice England never hesitated; like a boy set
    free from school, she dashed out to meet her danger with
    laughter. Her high spirits have never failed her. Her cavalry
    charge with hunting-calls upon their lips. Her Tommies go over
    the top humming music-hall ditties. The Hun is still "jolly old
    Fritz." The slaughter is still "a nice little war." Death is
    still "the early door." The mud-soaked "old Bills" of the
    trenches, cheerfully ignoring vermin, rain and shell fire,
    continue to wind up their epistles with, "Hoping this finds you
    in the pink, as it leaves me at present." They are always in
    the pink for epistolary purposes, whatever the strafing or the
    weather. That's England; at all costs, she has to be a
    sportsman. I wonder she doesn't write on the crosses above her
    dead, "<i>Yours in the pink:</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"
       id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span> <i>a British soldier, killed
       in action</i>." England is in the pink for the duration of
       the war.</p>

    <p>The Frenchman cannot understand us, and I don't blame him.
    Our high spirits impress him as untimely and indecent. War for
    him is not a sport. How could it be, with his homesteads
    ravaged, his cities flattened, his women violated, his
    populations prisoners in occupied territories? For him war is a
    martyrdom which he embraces with a fierce gladness. His spirit
    is well illustrated by an incident that happened the other day
    in Paris. A descendant of Racine, a well-known figure at the
    opera, was travelling in the Metro when he spotted a poilu with
    a string of ten medals on his breast. The old aristocrat went
    over to the soldier and apologised for speaking to him. "But,"
    he said, "I have never seen any poilu with so many decorations.
    You must be of the very bravest."</p>

    <p>"That is nothing," the man replied sombrely; "before they
    kill me I shall have won many more. This I earned in revenge
    for my wife, who was brutally murdered. And this and this and
    this for my daughters who were ravished. And these
    others&mdash;they are for my sons who are now no more."</p>

    <p>"My friend, if you will let me, I should like to embrace
    you." And there, in the sight of all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"
       id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span> the passengers, the old
       habitué of the opera and the common soldier kissed each
       other. The one satisfaction that the French blind have is in
       counting the number of Boche they have slaughtered. "In that
       raid ten of us killed fifty," one will say; "the memory
       makes me very happy."</p>

    <p>Curiously enough the outrage that makes the Frenchman most
    revengeful is not the murder of his family or the defilement of
    his women, but the wilful killing of his land and orchards. The
    land gave birth to all his flesh and blood; when his farm is
    laid waste wilfully, it is as though the mother of all his
    generations was violated. This accounts for the indomitable way
    in which the peasants insist on staying on in their houses
    under shell-fire, refusing to depart till they are forcibly
    turned out.</p>

    <p>We in England, still less in America, have never approached
    the loathing which is felt for the Boche in France. Men spit as
    they utter his name, as though the very word was foul in the
    mouth.</p>

    <p>In the face of all that they have suffered, I do not wonder
    that the French misunderstand the easy good-humour with which
    we English go out to die. In their eyes and with the continual
    throbbing of their wounds, this war is an occasion for neither
    good-humour nor sportsmanship, but for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"
       id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span> the wrath of a Hebrew
       Jehovah, which only blows can appease or make articulate. If
       every weapon were taken from their hands and all their young
       men were dead, with naked fists those who were left would
       smite&mdash;smite and smite. It is fitting that they should
       feel this way, seeing themselves as they do perpetually
       frescoed against the sky-line of sacrifice; but I am glad
       that our English boys can laugh while they die.</p>

    <p>In trying to explain the change I found in England after war
    had commenced, I mentioned Henley and the boat-race crowds. I
    don't think it was a change; it was only a bringing to the
    surface of something that had been there always. Some years ago
    I was at Henley when the Belgians carried off the Leander Cup
    from the most crack crew that England could bring together.
    Evening after evening through the Regatta week the fear had
    been growing that we should lose, yet none of that fear was
    reflected in our attitude towards our Belgian guests. Each
    evening as they came up the last stretch of river, leading by
    lengths and knocking another contestant out, the spectators
    cheered them madly. Their method of rowing smashed all our
    traditions; it wasn't correct form; it wasn't anything. It
    ought to have made one angry. But these chaps were game; they
    were winning. "Let's play fair," said the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"
       id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span> river; so they cheered them.
       On the last night when they beat Leander, looking fresh as
       paint, leading by a length and taking the championship out
       of England, you would never have guessed by the flicker of
       an eyelash that it wasn't the most happy conclusion of a
       good week's sport for every oarsman present.</p>

    <p>It's the same spirit essentially that England is showing
    to-day. She cheers the winner. She trusts in her strength for
    another day. She insists on playing fair. She considers it bad
    manners to lose one's temper. She despises to hate back. She
    has carried this spirit so far that if you enter the college
    chapels of Oxford to-day, you will find inscribed on memorial
    tablets to the fallen not only the names of Britishers, but
    also the names of German Rhodes Scholars, who died fighting for
    their country against the men who were once their friends.
    Generosity, justice, disdain of animosity-these virtues were
    learnt on the playing-fields and race-courses. England knows
    their value; she treats war as a sport because so she will
    fight better. For her that approach to adversity is normal.</p>

    <p>With us war is a sport. With the French it is a martyrdom.
    But with the Americans it is a job. "We've got four years to do
    this job. We've got four years to do this job," as the American
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
       id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span> soldiers chant. I think in
       these three attitudes towards war as a martyrdom, as sport
       and as a job, you get reflected the three gradations of
       distance by which each nation is divided from the trenches.
       France had her tribulation thrust upon her. She was
       attacked; she had no option. England, separated by the
       Channel, could have restrained the weight of her strength,
       biding her time. She had her moment of choice, but rushed to
       the rescue the moment the first Hun bayonet gleamed across
       the Belgian threshold. America, fortified by the Atlantic,
       could not believe that her peace was in any way assailed.
       The idea seemed too madly far-fetched. At first she refused
       to realise that this apportioning of a continent three
       thousand miles distant from Germany was anything but a
       pipe-dream of diplomats in their dotage. It was
       inconceivable that it could be the practical and achievable
       cunning of military bullies and strategists. The truth
       dawned too slowly for her to display any vivid burst of
       anger. "It isn't true," she said. And then, "It seems
       incredible." And lastly, "What infernal impertinence!"</p>

    <p>It was the infernal impertinence of Germany's schemes for
    transatlantic plunder that roused the average American. It
    awoke in him a terrible, calm anger&mdash;a feeling that some
    one must be punished. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"
       id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span> It was as though he broke off
       suddenly in what he was doing and commenced rolling up his
       shirt-sleeves. There was a grim, surprised determination
       about his quietness, which had not been seen in any other
       belligerent nation. France became consciously and tragically
       heroic when war commenced. England became unwontedly
       cheerful because life was moving on grander levels. In
       America there was no outward change. The old habit of
       feverish industry still persisted, but was intensified and
       applied in unselfish directions.</p>

    <p>What has impressed me most in my tour of the American
    activities in France is the businesslike relentlessness of the
    preparations. Everything is being done on a titanic scale and
    everything is being done to last. The ports, the railroads, the
    plants that are being constructed will still be standing a
    hundred years from now. There's no "Home for Christmas"
    optimism about America's method of making war. One would think
    she was expecting to be still fighting when all the present
    generation is dead. She is investing billions of dollars in
    what can only be regarded as permanent improvements. The
    handsomeness of her spirit is illustrated by the fact that she
    has no understanding with the French for
    reimbursement.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"
       id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span>

    <p>In sharp contrast with this handsomeness of spirit is the
    iciness of her purpose as regards the Boche. I heard no hatred
    of the individual German&mdash;only the deep conviction that
    Prussianism must be crushed at all costs. The American does not
    speak of "Poor old Fritz" as we do on our British Front. He's
    too logical to be sorry for his enemy. His attitude is too
    sternly impersonal for him to be moved by any emotions, whether
    of detestation or charity, as regards the Hun. All he knows is
    that a Frankenstein machinery has been set in motion for the
    destruction of the world; to counteract it he is creating
    another piece of machinery. He has set about his job in just
    the same spirit that he set about overcoming the difficulties
    of the Panama Canal. He has been used to overcoming the
    obstinacies of Nature; the human obstinacies of his new task
    intrigue him. I believe that, just as in peace times big
    business was his romance and the wealth which he gained from it
    was often incidental, so in France the job as a job impels him,
    quite apart from its heroic object. After all, smashing the
    Pan-Germanic Combine is only another form of
    trust-busting&mdash;trust-busting with aeroplanes and guns
    instead of with law and ledgers.</p>

    <p>There is something almost terrifying to me about this quiet
    collectedness&mdash;this Pierpont Morgan
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"
       id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span> touch of sphinxlike aloofness
       from either malice or mercy. Just as America once said,
       "Business is business" and formed her world-combines,
       collaring monopolies and allowing the individual to survive
       only by virtue of belonging to the fittest, so now she is
       saying, "War is war"&mdash;something to be accomplished with
       as little regard to landscapes as blasting a railroad across
       a continent.</p>

    <p>For the first time in the history of this war Germany is "up
    against" a nation which is going to fight her in her own
    spirit, borrowing her own methods. This statement needs
    explaining; its truth was first brought to my attention at
    American General Headquarters. The French attitude towards the
    war is utterly personal; it is bayonet to bayonet. It depends
    on the unflinching courage of every individual French man and
    woman. The English attitude is that of the knight-errant,
    seeking high adventures and welcoming death in a noble cause.
    But the German attitude disregards the individual and knows
    nothing of gallantry. It lacks utterly the spiritual elation
    which made the strength of the French at Verdun and of the
    English at Mons. The German attitude is that of a soulless
    organisation, invented for one purpose&mdash;profitable
    conquest. War for the Hun is not a final and dreaded atonement
    for the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"
       id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span> restoring of justice to the
       world; it is a business undertaking which, as he is fond of
       telling us, has never failed to yield him good interest on
       his capital. I have seen a good deal of the capital he has
       invested in the battlefields he has lost&mdash;men smashed
       to pulp, bruised by shells out of resemblance to anything
       human, the breeding place of flies and pestilence, no longer
       the homes of loyalties and affections. I cannot conceive
       what percentage of returns can be said to compensate for the
       agony expended on such indecent Golgothas. However, the Hun
       has assured us that it pays him; he flatters himself that he
       is a first-class business man.</p>

    <p>But so does the American, and he knows the game from more
    points of view. For years he has patterned his schools and
    colleges on German educational methods. What applies to his
    civilian centres of learning applies to his military as well.
    German text-books gave the basis for all American military
    thought. American officers have been trained in German strategy
    just as thoroughly as if they had lived in Potsdam. At the
    start of the war many of them were in the field with the German
    armies as observers. They are able to synchronise their
    thoughts with the thoughts of their German enemies and at the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"
       id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span> same time to take advantage
       of all that the Allies can teach them.</p>

    <p>"War is a business," the Germans have said. The Americans,
    with an ideal shining in their eyes, have replied, "Very well.
    We didn't want to fight you; but now that you have forced us,
    we will fight you on your own terms. We will make war on you as
    a business, for we are businessmen. We will crush you coldly,
    dispassionately, without rancour, without mercy till we have
    proved to you that war is not profitable business, but
    hell."</p>

    <p>The American, as I have met him in France, has not changed
    one iota from the man that he was in New York or Chicago. He
    has transplanted himself untheatrically to the scenes of
    battlefields and set himself undisturbedly to the task of
    dying. There is an amazing normality about him. You find him in
    towns, ancient with châteaux and wonderful with age; he is
    absolutely himself, keenly efficient and irreverently modern.
    Everywhere, from the Bay of Biscay to the Swiss border, from
    the Mediterranean to the English Channel, you see the lean
    figure and the slouch hat of the U.S.A. soldier. He is
    invariably well-conducted, almost always alone and usually
    gravely absorbed in himself. The excessive gravity of the
    American in khaki has astonished the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"
       id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span> men of the other armies who
       feel that, life being uncertain, it is well to make as
       genial a use of it as possible while it lasts. The soldier
       from the U.S.A. seems to stand always restless, alert,
       alone, listening&mdash;waiting for the call to come. He
       doesn't sink into the landscape the way other troops have
       done. His impatience picks him out&mdash;the impatience of a
       man in France solely for one purpose. I have seen him thus a
       thousand times, standing at street-corners, in the crowd but
       not of it, remarkable to every one but himself. Every man
       and officer I have spoken to has just one thing to say about
       what is happening inside him, "Let them take off my khaki
       and send me back to America, or else hurry me into the
       trenches. I came here to get started on this job; the
       waiting makes me tired."</p>

    <p>"Let me get into the trenches," that was the cry of the
    American soldier that I heard on every hand. Having witnessed
    his eagerness, cleanness and intensity, I ask no more questions
    as to how he will acquit himself.</p>

    <p>I have presented him as an extremely practical person, but
    no American that I ever met was solely practical. If you watch
    him closely you will always find that he is doing practical
    things for an idealistic end. The American who accumulates a
    fortune to himself, whether it be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"
       id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span> through corralling railroads,
       controlling industries, developing mines or establishing a
       chain of dry-goods stores, doesn't do it for the money only,
       but because he finds in business the poetry of creating,
       manipulating, evolving&mdash;the exhilaration and adventure
       of swaying power. And so there came a day when I caught my
       American soldier dreaming and off his guard.</p>

    <p>All day I had been motoring through high uplands. It was a
    part of France with which I was totally unfamiliar. A thin mist
    was drifting across the country, getting lost in valleys where
    it piled up into fleecy mounds, getting caught in tree-tops
    where it fluttered like tattered banners. Every now and then,
    with the suddenness of our approach, we would startle an aged
    shepherd, muffled and pensive as an Arab, strolling slowly
    across moorlands, followed closely by the sentinel goats which
    led his flock. The day had been strangely mystic. Time seemed a
    mood. I had ceased to trouble about where I was going; that I
    knew my ultimate destination was sufficient. The way that led
    to it, which I had never seen before, should never see again
    perhaps, and through which I travelled at the rate of an
    express, seemed a fairy non-existent Hollow Land. Landscapes
    grew blurred with the speed of our passage. They loomed up on
    us like waves, stayed <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"
       id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span> with us for a second and
       vanished. The staff-officer, who was my conductor, drowsed
       on his seat beside the driver. He had wearied himself in the
       morning, taking me now here to see an American Division
       putting on a manoeuvre, now there to where the artillery
       were practising, then to another valley where machine-guns
       tapped like thousands of busy typewriters working on death's
       manuscript. After that had come bayonet charges against
       dummies, rifle-ranges and trench-digging&mdash;all the
       industrious pretence at slaughter which prefaces the
       astounding actuality. We were far away from all that now;
       the brown figures had melted into the brownness of the
       hills. There might have been no war. Perhaps there wasn't.
       Never was there a world more grey and quiet. I grew sleepy.
       My head nodded. I opened my eyes, pulled myself together and
       again nodded. The roar of the engine was soothing. The rush
       of wind lay heavy against my eye-lids. It seemed odd that I
       should be here and not in the trenches. When I was in the
       line I had often made up life's deficiencies by imagining,
       imagining.... Perhaps I was really in the line now. I
       wouldn't wake up to find out. That would come
       presently&mdash;it always had.</p>

    <p>We were slowing down. I opened my eyes lazily. No, we
    weren't stopping&mdash;only going
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
       id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span> through a village. What a
       quaint grey village it was&mdash;worth looking at if I
       wasn't so tired. I was on the point of drowsing off again
       when I caught sight of a word written on a sign-board,
       <i>Domrémy</i>. My brain cleared. I sat up with a jerk. It
       was magic that I should find myself here without
       warning&mdash;at Domrémy, the Bethlehem of warrior-woman's
       mercy. I had dreamed from boyhood of this place as a
       legend&mdash;a memory of white chivalry to be found on no
       map, a record of beauty as utterly submerged as the lost
       land of Lyonesse. Hauntingly the words came back, "Who is
       this that cometh from Domrémy? Who is she in bloody
       coronation robes from Rheims? Who is she that cometh with
       blackened flesh from walking in the furnaces of Rouen? This
       is she, the shepherd girl...." All about me on the little
       hills were the woodlands through which she must have led her
       sheep and wandered with her heavenly visions.</p>

    <p>We had come to a bend in the village street. Where the road
    took a turn stood an aged church; nestling beside it in a
    little garden was a grey, semi-fortified mediæval dwelling. The
    garden was surrounded by high spiked railings, planted on a low
    stone wall. Sitting on the wall beside the entrance was an
    American soldier. He had a small French child on either
    knee&mdash;one <span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"
       id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span> arm about each of them; thus
       embarrassed he was doing his patient best to roll a Bull
       Durham cigarette. The children were vividly interested; they
       laughed up into the soldier's face. One of them was a boy,
       the other a girl. The long golden curls of the girl brushed
       against the soldier's cheek. The three heads bent together,
       almost touching. The scene was timelessly human, despite the
       modernity of the khaki. Joan of Arc might have been that
       little girl.</p>

    <p>I stopped the driver, got out and approached the group. The
    soldier jumped to attention and saluted. In answer to my
    question, he said, "Yes, this is where she lived. That's her
    house&mdash;that grey cottage with scarcely any windows.
    Bastien le Page could never have seen it; it isn't a bit like
    his picture in the Metropolitan Gallery."</p>

    <p>He spoke in a curiously intimate way as if he had known Joan
    of Arc and had spoken with her there&mdash;as if she had only
    just departed. It was odd to reflect that America had still
    lain hidden behind the Atlantic when Joan walked the world.</p>

    <p>We entered the gate into the garden, the American soldier,
    the children and I together. The little girl, with that wistful
    confidence that all French children show for men in khaki,
    slipped <span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"
       id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span> her grubby little paw into my
       hand. I expect Joan was often grubby like that.</p>

    <p>Brown winter leaves strewed the path. The grass was bleached
    and dead. At our approach an old sheep-dog rattled his chain
    and looked out of his kennel. He was shaggy and matted with
    years. His bark was so weak that it broke in the middle. He was
    a Rip Van Winkle of a sheep-dog&mdash;the kind of dog you would
    picture in a fairy-tale. One couldn't help feeling that he had
    accompanied the shepherd girl and had kept the flock from
    straying while she spoke with her visions. All those centuries
    ago he had seen her ride away&mdash;ride away to save
    France&mdash;and she had not come back. All through the
    centuries he had waited; at every footstep on the path he had
    come hopefully out from his kennel, wagging his tail and
    barking ever more weakly. He would not believe that she was
    dead. And it was difficult to believe it in that ancient quiet.
    If ever France needed her, it was now.</p>

    <p>Across my memory flashed the words of a dreamer, prophetic
    in the light of recent events, "Daughter of Domrémy, when the
    gratitude of thy king shall awaken, thou wilt be sleeping the
    sleep of the dead. Call her, King of France, but she will not
    hear thee. Cite her by the apparitors to come and receive a
    robe of honour, but she <span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
       id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span> will not be found. When the
       thunders of universal France, as even yet may happen, shall
       proclaim the grandeur of the poor shepherd girl that gave up
       her all for her country, thy ear, young shepherd girl, will
       have been deaf five centuries."</p>

    <p>Quite illogically it seemed to me that January evening that
    this American soldier was the symbol of the power that had come
    in her stead.</p>

    <p>The barking of the dog had awakened a bowed old Mother
    Hubbard lady. She opened the door of her diminutive castle and
    peered across the threshold, jingling her keys.</p>

    <p>Would we come in? Ah, Monsieur from America was there! He
    was always there when he was not training, playing with the
    children and rolling cigarettes. And Monsieur, the English
    officer, perhaps he did not know that she was descended from
    Joan's family. Oh, yes, there was no mistake about it; that was
    why she had been made custodian. She must light the lamp.
    There! That was better. There was not much to see, but if we
    would follow....</p>

    <p>We stepped down into a flagged room like a
    cellar&mdash;cold, ascetic and bare. There was a big open
    fire-place, with a chimney hooded by massive masonry and
    blackened by the fires of immemorial winters. This was where
    Joan's parents <span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"
       id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span> had lived. She had probably
       been born here. The picture that formed in my mind was not
       of Joan, but that other woman unknown to history&mdash;her
       mother, who after Joan had left the village and rumours of
       her battles and banquets drifted back, must have sat there
       staring into the blazing logs, her peasant's hands folded in
       her lap, brooding, wondering, hoping, fearing&mdash;fearing
       as the mothers of soldiers have throughout the ages.</p>

    <p>And this was Joan's brother's room&mdash;a cheerless place
    of hewn stone. What kind of a man could he have been? What were
    his reflections as he went about his farm-work and thought of
    his sister at the head of armies? Was he merely a lout or
    something worse&mdash;the prototype of our Conscientious
    Objector: a coward who disguised his cowardice with moral
    scruples?</p>

    <p>And this was Joan's room&mdash;a cell, with a narrow slit at
    the end through which one gained a glimpse of the church.
    Before this slit she had often knelt while the angels drifted
    from the belfry like doves to peer in on her. The place was
    sacred. How many nights had she spent here with girlish folded
    hands, her face ecstatic, the cold eating into her tender body?
    I see her blue for lack of charity, forgotten, unloved,
    neglected&mdash;the symbol of misunderstanding and loneliness.
    They told her she was mad. She was a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"
       id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span> laughing stock in the
       village. The world could find nothing better for her to do
       than driving sheep through the bitter woodlands; but God
       found time to send his angels. Yes, she was mad&mdash;mad as
       Christ was in Galilee&mdash;mad enough to save others when
       she could not save herself. How nearly the sacrifice of this
       most child-like of women parallels the sacrifice of the most
       God-like of men! Both were born in a shepherd community;
       both forewent the humanity of love and parenthood; both gave
       up their lives that the world might be better; both were
       royally apparelled in mockery; both followed their visions;
       for each the price of following was death. She, too, was
       despised and rejected; as a sheep before her shearers is
       dumb, so she opened not her mouth.</p>

    <p>That is all there is to see at Domrémy; three starveling,
    stone-paved rooms, a crumbling church, a garden full of dead
    leaves, an old dog growing mangy in his kennel and the
    wind-swept cathedral of the woodlands. The soul of France was
    born there in the humble body of a peasant-girl; yes, and more
    than the soul of France&mdash;the gallantry of all womanhood.
    God must be fond of His peasants; I think they will be His
    aristocracy in Heaven.</p>

    <p>The old lady led us out of the house. There
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"
       id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span> was one more thing she wished
       to show us. The sunset light was still in the tree-tops, but
       her eyes were dim; she thought that night had already
       gathered. Holding her lamp above her head, she pointed to a
       statue in a niche above the doorway. It had been placed
       there by order of the King of France after Joan was dead.
       But it wasn't so much the statue that she wanted us to look
       at; it was the mutilations that were upon it. She was filled
       with a great trembling of indignation. "Yes, gaze your fill
       upon it, Messieurs," she said; "it was <i>les Boches</i> did
       that. They were here in 1870. To others she may be a saint,
       but to <i>them</i>&mdash;Bah!" and she spat, "a woman is
       less than a woman always."</p>

    <p>When we turned to go she was still cursing <i>les Boches</i>
    beneath her breath, tremblingly holding up the lamp above her
    head that she might forget nothing of their defilement. The old
    dog rattled his chain as we passed; he knew us now and did not
    trouble to come out. The dead leaves whispered beneath our
    tread.</p>

    <p>At the gate we halted. I turned to my American soldier. "How
    long before you go into the line?"</p>

    <p>He was carrying the little French girl in his arms. As he
    glanced up to answer, his face caught the sunset. "Soon now.
    The sooner, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
       id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span> the better. She ...," and I
       knew he meant no living woman. "This place ... I don't know
       how to express it. But everything here makes you want to
       fight,&mdash;makes you ashamed of standing idle. If she
       could do that&mdash;well, I guess that I...."</p>

    <p>He made no attempt to fill his eloquent silences; and so I
    left. As the car gathered speed, plunging into the pastoral
    solitudes, I looked back. The last sight I had of Domrémy was a
    grey little garden, made sacred by the centuries, and an
    American soldier standing with a French child in his arms, her
    golden hair lying thickly against his neck.</p>

    <p>On the surface the American is unemotionally practical, but
    at heart he is a dreamer, first, last and always. If the
    Americans have merited any criticism in France, it is owing to
    the vastness of their plans; the tremendous dream of their
    preparations postpones the beginning of the reality. Their
    mistake, if they have made a mistake, is an error of
    generosity. They are building with a view to flinging millions
    into the line when thousands a little earlier would be of
    superlative advantage. They had the choice of dribbling their
    men over in small contingents or of waiting till they could put
    a fighting-force into the field so overwhelming in equipment
    and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"
       id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span> numbers that its weight would
       be decisive. They were urged to learn wisdom from England's
       example and not to waste their strength by putting men into
       the trenches in a hurry before they were properly trained.
       England was compelled to adopt this chivalrous folly by the
       crying need of France. It looked in the Spring of 1917,
       before Russia had broken down or the pressure on the Italian
       front had become so menacing, as though the Allies could
       afford to ask America to conduct her war on the lines of big
       business. America jumped at the chance&mdash;big business
       being the task to which her national genius was best suited.
       If her Allies could hold on long enough, she would build her
       fleet and appear with an army of millions that would bring
       the war to a rapid end. Her rôle was to be that of the
       toreador in the European bull-fight.</p>

    <p>But big business takes time and usually loses money at the
    start. In the light of recent developments, we would rather
    have the bird-in-the-hand of 300,000 Americans actually
    fighting than the promise of a host a year from now. People at
    home in America realised this in January. They were so afraid
    that their Allies might feel disappointed. They were so keen to
    achieve tangible results in the war that they grew impatient
    with the long delay. They weren't
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"
       id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span> interested in seeing other
       nations going over the top&mdash;the same nations who had
       been over so many times; they wanted to see their sons and
       brothers at once given the opportunity to share the wounds
       and the danger. Their attitude was Spartan and splendid;
       they demanded a curtailment of their respite that they might
       find themselves afloat on the crimson tide. The cry of the
       civilians in America was identical with that of their men in
       France. "Let them take off our khaki or else hurry us into
       the trenches. We want to get started. This waiting makes us
       tired."</p>

    <p>And the civilians in America had earned a right to make
    their demand. Industrially, financially, philanthropically,
    from every point of view they had sacrificed and played the
    game, both by the Allies and their army. When they, as
    civilians, had been so willing to wear the stigmata of
    sacrifice, they were jealous lest their fighting men should be
    baulked of their chance of making those sacrifices appear worth
    while.</p>

    <p>There have been many accusations in the States with regard
    to the supposed breakdown of their military organization in
    France&mdash;accusations inspired by generosity towards the
    Allies. From what I have seen, and I have been given liberal
    opportunities to see everything, I do not think that those
    accusations are justified. As a combatant
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"
       id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span> of another nation, I have my
       standards of comparison by which to judge and I frankly
       state that I was amazed with the progress that had been
       made. It is a progress based on a huge scale and therefore
       less impressive to the layman than if the scale had been
       less ambitious. What I saw were the foundations of an
       organisation which can be expanded to handle a
       fighting-machine which staggers the imagination. What the
       layman expects to see are Hun trophies and Americans coming
       out of the line on stretchers. He will see all that, if he
       waits long enough, for the American military hospitals in
       France are being erected to accommodate 200,000 wounded.</p>

    <p>Unfounded optimisms, which under no possible circumstances
    could ever have been realised, are responsible for the
    disappointment felt in America. Inasmuch as these optimisms
    were widely accepted in England and France, civilian America's
    disappointment will be shared by the Allies, unless some hint
    of the truth is told as to what may be expected and what great
    preparations are under construction. It was generally believed
    that by the spring of 1918 America would have half a million
    men in the trenches and as many more behind the lines, training
    to become reinforcements. People who spoke this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"
       id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span> way could never have seen a
       hundred thousand men or have stopped to consider what
       transport would be required to maintain them at a distance
       of more than three thousand miles from their base. It was
       also believed that by the April of 1918, one year after the
       declaring of war, America would have manufactured ten
       thousand planes, standardised all their parts, trained the
       requisite number of observers and pilots, and would have
       them flying over the Hun lines. Such beliefs were pure
       moonshine, incapable of accomplishment; but there are facts
       to be told which are highly honourable.</p>

    <p>So far I have tried to give a glimpse of America's fighting
    spirit in facing up to her job; now, in as far as it is
    allowed, I want to give a sketch of her supreme earnestness as
    proved by what she has already achieved in France. The
    earnestness of her civilians should require no further proof
    than the readiness with which they accepted national
    conscription within a few hours of entering the war&mdash;a
    revolutionising departure which it took England two years of
    fighting even to contemplate, and which can hardly be said to
    be in full operation yet, so long as conscientious objectors
    are allowed to air their so-called consciences. In America the
    conscientious objector is not regarded; he is listened to as
    only one of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"
       id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> two things&mdash;a deserter
       or a traitor. The earnestness of America's fighting man
       requires no proving; his only grievance is that he is not in
       the trenches. Yet so long as the weight of America is not
       felt to be turning the balance dramatically in our favour,
       the earnestness of America will be open to challenge both by
       Americans and by the Allies. What I saw in France in the
       early months of this year has filled me with unbounded
       optimism. I feel the elated certainty, as never before even
       in the moment of the most successful attack, that the Hun's
       fate is sealed. What is more, I have grounds for believing
       that he knows it&mdash;knows that the collapse of Russia
       will profit him nothing because he cannot withstand the
       avalanche of men from America. Already he hears them, as I
       have seen them, training in their camps from the Pacific to
       the Atlantic, racing across the Ocean in their grey
       transports, marching along the dusty roads of two
       continents, a procession locust-like in multitude,
       stretching half about the world, marching and singing
       indomitably, "We've got four years to do this job." From
       behind the Rhine he has caught their singing; it grows ever
       nearer, stronger. It will take time for that avalanche to
       pyramid on the Western Front; but when it has piled up, it
       will rush forward, fall on him and crush him. He knows
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"
       id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span> something else, which fills
       him with a still more dire sense of calamity&mdash;that
       because America's honour has been jeopardised, of all the
       nations now fighting she will be the last to lay down her
       arms. She has given herself four years to do her job; when
       her job is ended, it will be with Prussianism as it was with
       Jezebel, "They that went to bury her found no more of her
       than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands. And
       her carcase was as dung upon the face of the field, so that
       men should not say, 'This is Jezebel.'"</p>

    <p>As an example of what America is accomplishing, I will take
    a sample port in France. It was of tenth-rate importance,
    little more than a harbour for coastwise vessels and
    ocean-going tramps when the Americans took it over; by the time
    they have finished, it will be among the first ports of Europe.
    It is only one of several that they are at present enlarging
    and constructing. The work already completed has been done in
    the main under the direction of the engineers who marched
    through London in the July of last year. I visited the port in
    January, so some idea can be gained of how much has been
    achieved in a handful of months.</p>

    <p>The original French town still has the aspect of a
    prosperous fishing-village. There are two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"
       id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span> main streets with shops on
       them; there is one out-of-date hotel; there are a few modern
       dwellings facing the sea. For the rest, the town consists of
       cottages, alleys and open spaces where the nets were once
       spread to dry. To-day in a vast circle, as far as eye can
       reach, a city of huts has grown up. In those huts live men
       of many nations, Americans, French, German prisoners,
       negroes. They are all engaged in the stupendous task of
       construction. The capacity of the harbour basin is being
       multiplied fifty times, the berthing capacity trebled, the
       unloading facilities multiplied by ten. A railroad yard is
       being laid which will contain 225 miles of track and 870
       switches. An immense locomotive-works is being erected for
       the repairing and assembling of rolling-stock from America.
       It was originally planned to bring over 960 standard
       locomotives and 30,000 freight-cars from the States, all
       equipped with French couplers and brakes so that they could
       become a permanent part of the French railroad system. These
       figures have since been somewhat reduced by the purchase of
       rolling-stock in Europe. Reservoirs are being built at some
       distance from the town which will be able to supply six
       millions gallons of purified water a day. In order to obtain
       the necessary quantity of pipe, piping will be torn up from
       various of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"
       id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span> the water-systems in America
       and brought across the Atlantic. As the officer, who was my
       informant remarked, "Rather than see France go short, some
       city in the States will have to haul water in carts."</p>

    <p>As proof of the efficiency with which materials from America
    are being furnished, when the engineers arrived on the scene
    with 225 miles of track to lay, they found 100 miles of rails
    and spikes already waiting for them. Of the 870 switches
    required, 350 were already on hand. Of the ties required,
    one-sixth were piled up for them to be going on with. Not so
    bad for a nation quite new to the war-game and living three
    thousand miles beyond the horizon!</p>

    <p>On further enquiry I learnt that six million cubic yards of
    filling were necessary to raise the ground of the railroad yard
    to the proper level. In order that the work may be hurried,
    dredges are being brought across the Atlantic and, if
    necessary, harbour construction in the States will be
    curtailed.</p>

    <p>I was interested in the personnel employed in this work.
    Here, as elsewhere, I found that the engineering and organising
    brains of America are largely in France. One colonel was head
    of the marble industry in the States; another had been
    vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"
       id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span> Another man, holding a
       sergeant's rank was general manager of the biggest fishing
       company. Another, a private in the ranks, was chief engineer
       of the American Aluminum Company. A major was general
       manager of The Southern Pacific. Another colonel was
       formerly controller of the currency and afterwards president
       of the Central Trust Company of Illinois. A captain was
       chief engineer and built the aqueducts over the keys of the
       Florida East Coast Railroad. As with us, you found men of
       the highest social and professional grade serving in every
       rank of the American Army; one, a society man and banker,
       was running a gang of negroes whose job it was to shovel
       sand into cars. In peace times thirty thousand pounds a year
       could not have bought him. What impressed me even more than
       the line of communications itself was the quality of the men
       engaged on its construction. As one of them said to me, "Any
       job that they give us engineers to do over here is likely to
       be small in comparison with the ones we've had to tackle in
       America." The man who said this had previously done his
       share in the building of the Panama Canal. There were others
       I met, men who had spanned rivers in Alaska, flung rails
       across the Rockies, built dams in the arid regions,
       performed engineering feats in China, Africa,
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"
       id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span> Russia&mdash;in all parts of
       the world. They were trained to be undaunted by the hugeness
       of any task; they'd always beaten Nature in the long run.
       Their cheerful certainty that America in France was more
       than up to her job maintained a constant wave of
       enthusiasm.</p>

    <p>It may be asked why it is necessary in an old-established
    country like France, to waste time in enlarging harbours before
    you can make effective war. The answer is simple: France has
    not enough ports of sufficient size to handle the tonnage that
    is necessary to support the Allied armies within her borders.
    America's greatest problem is tonnage. She has the men and the
    materials in prodigal quantities, but they are all three
    thousand miles away. Before the men can be brought over, she
    has to establish her means of transport and line of
    communications, so as to make certain that she can feed and
    clothe them when once she has got them into the front-line.
    There are two ways of economising on tonnage. One is to
    purchase in Europe. In this way, up to February, The Purchasing
    Board of the Americans had saved ninety days of transatlantic
    traffic. The other way is to have modern docks, well
    railroaded, so that vessels can be unloaded in the least
    possible space of time and sent back for other cargoes. Hence
    it has been sane economy <span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"
       id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span> on the part of America to put
       much of her early energy into construction rather than into
       fighting. Nevertheless, it has made her an easy butt for
       criticism both in the States and abroad, since the only
       proof to the newspaper-reader that America is at war is the
       amount of front-line that she is actually defending.</p>

    <p>I had heard much of what was going on at a certain place
    which was to be the intermediate point in the American line of
    communications. I had studied a blue-print map and had been
    amazed at its proportions. I was told, and can well believe,
    that when completed it was to be the biggest undertaking of its
    kind in the world. It was to be six and a half miles long by
    about one mile broad. It was to have four and a half million
    feet of covered storage and ten million feet of open storage.
    It was to contain over two hundred miles of track in its
    railroad yard and to house enough of the materials of war to
    keep a million men fully equipped for thirty days. In addition
    to this it was to have a plant, not for the repairing, but
    merely for the assembling of aeroplanes, which would employ
    twenty thousand men.</p>

    <p>I arrived there at night. There was no town. One stepped
    from the train into the open country. Far away in the distance
    there was a glimmering <span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"
       id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span> of fires and the scarlet of
       sparks shooting up between bare tree-tops. My first
       impression was of the fragrance of pines and, after that, as
       I approached the huts, of a memory more definite and
       elusively familiar. The swinging of lanterns helped to bring
       it back: I was remembering lumber-camps in the Rocky
       Mountains. The box-stove in the shack in which I slept that
       night and the roughly timbered walls served to heighten the
       illusion that I was in America. Next morning the illusion
       was completed. Here were men with mackinaws and green elk
       boots; here were cook-houses in which the only difference
       was that a soldier did the cooking instead of a Chinaman;
       and above all, here were fir and pines growing out of a
       golden soil, with a soft wind blowing overhead. And here, in
       an extraordinary way, the democracy of a lumber-camp had
       been reproduced: every one from the Colonel down was a
       worker; it was difficult, apart from their efficiency, to
       tell their rank.</p>

    <p>Early in the morning I started out on a gasolene-speeder to
    make the tour. At an astonishing rate, for the work had only
    been in hand three months, the vast acreage was being tracked
    and covered with the sheds. The sheds were not the kind I had
    been used to on my own front; they were built out of anything
    that came handy, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"
       id="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span> commenced with one sort of
       material and finished with another. Sometimes the
       cross-pieces in the roofs were still sweating, proving that
       it was only yesterday they had been cut down in the nearby
       wood. There was no look of permanence about anything. As the
       officer who conducted me said, "It's all run up&mdash;a race
       against time." And then he added with a twinkle in his eye,
       "But it's good enough to last four years."</p>

    <p>This was America in France in every sense of the word. One
    felt the atmosphere of rush. In the buildings, which should
    have been left when materials failed, but which had been
    carried to completion by pioneer methods, one recognised the
    resourcefulness of the lumberman of the West. Then came a touch
    of Eastern America, to me almost more replete with memory and
    excitement. In a flash I was transferred from a camp in France
    to the rock-hewn highway of Fifth Avenue, running through
    groves of sky-scrapers, garnished with sunshine and echoing
    with tripping footsteps. I could smell the asphalt soaked with
    gasolene and the flowers worn by the passing girls. The whole
    movement and quickness of the life I had lost flooded back on
    me. The sound I heard was the fate <i>motif</i> of the frantic
    opera of American endeavour. The truly wonderful thing was that
    I should hear it here, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"
       id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span> in a woodland in
       France&mdash;the rapid tapping of a steel-riveter at
       work.</p>

    <p>I learnt afterwards that I was not the only one to be
    carried away by that music, as of a monstrous wood-pecker in an
    iron forest. The first day the riveter was employed, the whole
    camp made excuses to come and listen to it. They stood round it
    in groups, deafened and thrilled&mdash;and a little homesick.
    What the bag-pipe is to the Scotchman, the steel-riveter is to
    the American&mdash;the instrument which best expresses his soul
    to a world which is different.</p>

    <p>I found that the riveter was being employed in the erection
    of an immense steel and concrete refrigerating plant, which was
    to have machinery for the production of its own ice and
    sufficient meat-storage capacity to provide a million men for
    thirty days. The water for the ice was being obtained from
    wells which had been already sunk. There was only surface water
    there when the Americans first struck camp.</p>

    <p>As another clear-cut example of what America is
    accomplishing in France, I will take an aviation-camp. This
    camp is one of several, yet it alone will be turning out from
    350 to 400 airmen a month. The area which it covers runs into
    miles. The Americans have their own ideas of aerial fighting
    tactics, which they will teach here
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"
       id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span> on an intensive course and
       try out on the Hun from time to time. Some of their experts
       have had the advantage of familiarising themselves with Hun
       aerial equipment and strategy; they were on his side of the
       line at the start of the war as neutral military observers.
       I liked the officer at the head of this camp; I was
       particularly pleased with some of his phrases. He was one of
       the first experts to fly with a Liberty engine. Without
       giving any details away, he assured me impressively that it
       was "an honest-to-God engine" and that his planes were
       equipped with "an honest-to-God machine-gun," and that he
       looked forward with cheery anticipation to the first
       encounter his chaps would have with "the festive Hun." He
       was one of the few Americans I had met who spoke with
       something of our scornful affection for the enemy. It
       indicated to me his absolute certainty that he could beat
       him at the flying game. On his lips the Hun was never the
       German or the Boche, but always "the festive Hun." You can
       afford to speak kindly, almost pityingly of some one you are
       going to vanquish. Hatred often indicates fear. Jocularity
       is a victorious sign.</p>

    <p>When I was in America last October a great effort was being
    made to produce an overwhelming quantity of aeroplanes.
    Factories, both large <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"
       id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span> and small, in every State
       were specializing on manufacturing certain parts, the idea
       being that so time would be saved and efficiency gained.
       These separate parts were to be collected and assembled at
       various big government plants. The aim was to turn out
       planes as rapidly as Ford Cars and to swamp the Hun with
       numbers. America is unusually rich in the human as well as
       the mechanical material for crushing the enemy in the air.
       In this service, as in all the others, the only difficulty
       that prevents her from making her fighting strength
       immediately felt is the difficulty of transportation. The
       road of ships across the Atlantic has to be widened; the
       road of steel from the French ports to the Front has to be
       tracked and multiplied in its carrying capacity. These
       difficulties on land and water are being rapidly overcome:
       by adding to the means of transportation; by increasing the
       efficiency of the transport facilities already existing; by
       lightening the tonnage to be shipped from the States by
       buying everything that is procurable in Europe. In the early
       months much of the available Atlantic tonnage was occupied
       with carrying the materials of construction: rails, engines,
       concrete, lumber, and all the thousand and one things that
       go to the housing of armies. This accounts for America's
       delay in starting fighting. For three years
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"
       id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span> Europe had been ransacked;
       very much of what America would require had to be brought.
       Such work does not make a dramatic impression on other
       nations, especially when they are impatient. Its value as a
       contribution towards defeating the Hun is all in the future.
       Only victories win applause in these days. Nevertheless,
       such work had to be done. To do it thoroughly, on a
       sufficiently large scale, in the face of the certain
       criticism which the delay for thoroughness would occasion,
       demanded bravery and patriotism on the part of those in
       charge of affairs. By the time this book is published their
       high-mindedness will have begun to be appreciated, for the
       results of it will have begun to tell. The results will tell
       increasingly as the war progresses. America is determined to
       have no Crimea scandals. The contentment and good condition
       of her troops in France will be largely owing to the
       organisation and care with which her line of communications
       has been constructed.</p>

    <p>The purely business side of war is very dimly comprehended
    either by the civilian or the combatant. The combatant, since
    he does whatever dying is to be done, naturally looks down on
    the business man in khaki. The civilian is inclined to think of
    war in terms of the mobile warfare of other days, when armies
    were rarely more <span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"
       id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span> than some odd thousands
       strong and were usually no more than expeditionary forces.
       Such armies by reason of their rapid movements and the
       comparative fewness of their numbers, were able to live on
       the countries through which they marched. But our fighting
       forces of to-day are the manhood of nations. The fronts
       which they occupy can scarcely boast a blade of grass. The
       towns which lie behind them have been picked clean to the
       very marrow. France herself, into which a military
       population of many millions has been poured, was never at
       the best of times entirely self-supporting. Whatever surplus
       of commodities the Allies possessed, they had already shared
       long before the spring of 1917. When America landed into the
       war, she found herself in the position of one who arrives at
       an overcrowded inn late at night. Whatever of food or
       accommodation the inn could afford had been already
       apportioned; consequently, before America could put her
       first million men into the trenches, she had to graft on to
       France a piece of the living tissue of her own industrial
       system&mdash;whole cities of repair-shops, hospitals,
       dwellings, store-houses, ice-plants, etc., together with the
       purely business personnel that go with them. These cities,
       though initially planned to maintain and furnish a minimum
       number of fighting men, had to be capable
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"
       id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span> of expansion so that they
       could ultimately support millions.</p>

    <p>Here are some facts and statistics which illustrate the big
    business of war as Americans have undertaken it. They have had
    to erect cold storage-plants, with mechanical means for
    ice-manufacture, of sufficient capacity to hold twenty-five
    million pounds of beef always in readiness.</p>

    <p>They are at present constructing two salvage depots which,
    when completed, will be the largest in the world. Here they
    will repair and make fit for service again, shoes, harness,
    clothing, webbing, tentage, rubber-boots, etc. Attached to
    these buildings there are to be immense laundries which will
    undertake the washing for all the American forces. In
    connection with the depots, there will be a Salvage Corps,
    whose work is largely at the Front. The materials which they
    collect will be sent back to the depots for sorting. Under the
    American system every soldier, on coming out of the trenches,
    will receive a complete new outfit, from the soles of his feet
    to the crown of his head. "This," the General who informed me
    said tersely, "is our way of solving the lice-problem."</p>

    <p>The Motor Transport also has its salvage depot. Knock-down
    buildings and machinery have been brought over from the States,
    and upwards <span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"
       id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span> of 4,000 trained mechanics
       for a start. This depot is also responsible for the repairs
       of all horse-drawn transport, except the artillery. The
       Quartermaster General's Department alone will have 35,000
       motor propelled vehicles and a personnel of 160,000 men.</p>

    <p>Every effort is being made to employ labour-saving devices
    to the fullest extent. The Supply Department expects to cut
    down its personnel by two-thirds through the efficient use of
    machinery and derricks. The order compelling all packages to be
    standardized in different graded sizes, so that they can be
    forwarded directly to the Front before being broken, has
    already done much to expedite transportation. The dimensions of
    the luggage of a modern army can be dimly realized when it is
    stated that the American armies will initially require
    twenty-four million square feet of covered and forty-one
    million of unroofed storage&mdash;not to mention the barrack
    space.</p>

    <p>Within the next few months they will require bakeries
    capable of feeding one million and a quarter men. These
    bakeries are divided into: the field bakeries, which are
    portable, and the mechanical bakeries which are stationary and
    on the line of communications. One of the latter had just been
    acquired and was described to me when I was in the American
    area. It was planned <span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"
       id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span> throughout with a view to
       labour-saving. It was so constructed that it could take the
       flour off the cars and, with practically no handling,
       convert it into bread at the rate of 750,000 lbs. a day.
       This struck me as a peculiarly American contribution to big
       business methods; but on expressing this opinion I was
       immediately corrected. This form of bakery was a British
       invention, which has been in use for some time on our lines.
       The Americans owed their possession of the bakery to the
       courtesy of the British Government, who had postponed their
       own order and allowed the Americans to fill theirs four
       months ahead of their contract.</p>

    <p>This is a sample of the kind of discovery that I was
    perpetually making. Two out of three times when I thought I had
    run across a characteristically American expression of
    efficiency, I was told that it had been copied from the
    British. I learnt more about my own army's business efficiency
    in studying it secondhand with the Americans, than I had ever
    guessed existed in all the time that I had been an inhabitant
    of the British Front. It is characteristic of us as a people
    that we like to pretend that we muddle our way into success. We
    advertise our mistakes and camouflage our virtues. We are
    almost ashamed of gaining credit for anything that we have done
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
       id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span> well. There is a fine
       dishonesty about this self-belittlement; but it is not
       always wise. During these first few months of their being at
       war the Americans have discovered England in almost as novel
       a sense as Columbus did America. It was a joy to be with
       them and to watch their surprise. The odd thing was that
       they had had to go to France to find us out. Here they were,
       the picked business men of the world's greatest industrial
       nation, frankly and admiringly hats off to British
       "muddle-headed" methods. Not only were they hats off to the
       methods, many of which they were copying, but they were also
       hats off to the generous helpfulness of our Government and
       Military authorities in the matter of advice, co-operation
       and supplies. From the private in the ranks, who had been
       trained by British N.C.O.'s and Officers, to the Generals at
       the head of departments, there was only one feeling
       expressed for Great Britain&mdash;that of a new sincerity of
       friendship and admiration. "John Bull and his brother
       Jonathan" had become more than an empty phrase; it expressed
       a true and living relation.</p>

    <p>A similar spirit of appreciation had grown up towards the
    French&mdash;not the emotional, histrionic, Lafayette
    appreciation with which the American troops sailed from
    America, but an <span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"
       id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span> appreciation based on
       sympathy and a knowledge of deeds and character. I think
       this spirit was best illustrated at Christmas when all over
       France, wherever American troops were billeted, the rank and
       file put their hands deep into their pockets to give the
       refugee children of their district the first real Christmas
       they had had since their country was invaded. Officers were
       selected to go to Paris to do the purchasing of the
       presents, and I know of at least one case in which the men's
       gift was so generous that there was enough money left over
       to provide for the children throughout the coming year.</p>

    <p>In France one hears none of that patronising criticism which
    used to exist in America with regard to the older
    nations&mdash;none of those arrogant assertions that "because
    we are younger we can do things better." The bias of the
    American in France is all the other way; he is near enough to
    the Judgment Day, which he is shortly to experience, to be
    reverent in the presence of those who have stood its test. He
    is in France to learn as well as to contribute. Between himself
    and his brother soldiers of the British and French armies,
    there exists an entirely manly and reciprocal respect. And it
    is reciprocal; both the individual British and French
    fighting-man, now that they have seen the American soldier,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
       id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span> are clamorous to have him
       adjacent to their line. The American has scarcely been
       blooded at this moment, and yet, having seen him, they are
       both certain that he's not the pal to let them down.</p>

    <p>The confidence that the American soldier has created among
    his soldier-Allies was best expressed to me by a British
    officer: "The British, French and Americans are the three great
    promise-keeping nations. For the first time in history we're
    standing together. We're promise-keepers banded together
    against the falsehood of Germany&mdash;that's why. It isn't
    likely that we shall start to tell lies to one another."</p>

    <p>Not likely!</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"

    <h2>III</h2>

    <h2>THE WAR OF COMPASSION</h2>

    <p>Officially America declared war on Germany in the spring of
    1917; actually she committed her heart to the allied cause in
    September, 1914, when the first shipment of the supplies of
    mercy arrived in Paris from the American Red Cross.</p>

    <p>There are two ways of waging war: you can fight with
    artillery and armed men; you can fight with ambulances and
    bandages. There's the war of destruction and the war of
    compassion. The one defeats the enemy directly with force; the
    other defeats him indirectly by maintaining the morale of the
    men who are fighting and, what is equally important, of the
    civilians behind the lines. Belgium would not be the utterly
    defiant and unconquered nation that she is to-day, had it not
    been for the mercy of Hoover and his disciples. Their voluntary
    presence made the captured Belgian feel that he was earning the
    thanks of all time&mdash;that the eyes of the world were upon
    him. They were neutrals, but their mere
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"
       id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span> presence condemned the
       cause that had brought them there. Their compassion waged
       war against the Hun. The same is true of the American
       Ambulance Units which followed the French Armies into the
       fiercest of the carnage. They confirmed the poilu in his
       burning sense of injustice. That they, who could have
       absented themselves, should choose the damnation of
       destruction and dare the danger, convinced the entire French
       nation of its own righteousness. And it was true of the
       girls at the American hospitals who nursed the broken bodies
       which their brothers had rescued. It was true of Miss Holt's
       <i>Lighthouse</i> for the training of blinded soldiers,
       which she established in Paris within eight months of war's
       commencement. It was true of the American Relief Clearing
       House in Paris which, up to January, 1917, had received 291
       shipments and had distributed eight million francs. By the
       time America put on armour, the American Red Cross, as the
       army's expert in the strategy of compassion, found that it
       had to take over more than eighty-six separate organisations
       which had been operating in France for the best part of two
       years.</p>

    <p>One cannot show pity with indignant hands and keep the mind
    neutral. The Galilean test holds true, "He who is not for me is
    against me." You cannot leave houses, lands, children,
    wife&mdash;everything <span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"
       id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span> that counts&mdash;for the
       Kingdom of Heaven's sake without developing a rudimentary
       aversion for the devil. All of which goes to prove that
       America's heart was fighting for the Allies long before her
       ambassador requested his passports from the Kaiser.</p>

    <p>The American Red Cross Commission landed in France on the
    12th of June, 1917, seven days ahead of the Expeditionary
    Force. It had taken less than five days to organise. Its first
    act was to convey a monetary gift to the French hospitals. The
    first actual American Red Cross contribution was made in April
    to the Number Five British Base Hospital. The first American
    soldiers in France were doctors and nurses. The first American
    fighting done in France was done with the weapons of pity. The
    chief function of the American Red Cross up to the present has
    been to "carry on" and to bridge the gap of unavoidable delays
    while the army is preparing.</p>

    <p>To prove that this "war of compassion" is no idle phrase,
    let me illustrate with one dramatic instance. When the Italian
    line broke under the pressure of Hun artillery and propaganda,
    the American Red Cross sent representatives forward to
    inaugurate relief work for the 700,000 refugees, who were
    pouring southward from the Friuti and Veneto, homeless, hungry,
    possessing <span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"
       id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span> nothing but misfortune,
       spreading despair and panic every step of the journey. Their
       bodies must be cared for&mdash;that was evident; it would be
       easy for them to carry disease throughout Italy. But the
       disease of their minds was an even greater danger; if their
       demoralisation were not checked, it would inevitably prove
       contagious.</p>

    <p>The first two representatives of the American Red Cross
    arrived in Rome on November 5th, with a quarter of a million
    dollars at their disposal. That night they had a soup-kitchen
    going and fed 400 people. Their first day's work is the record
    of an amazing spurt of energy. In that first day they sent
    money for relief to every American Consul in the districts
    affected. They mobilised the American colony in Rome and
    arranged by wire for similar organisations to be formed
    throughout the length and breadth of Italy, wherever they could
    lay hands on an American. On all principal junction points
    through which the refugees would pass, soup-kitchens were
    installed and clothes were purchased and ready to be
    distributed as the trains pulled into the stations. They were
    badly needed, for the passengers had endured all the rigours of
    the retreat with the soldiers. They had been under shell and
    machine-gun fire. They had been bombed by aeroplanes. No horror
    of warfare <span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"
       id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span> had been spared them. Their
       clothes were verminous with weeks of wearing. They were
       packed like cattle. Babies born on the journey were wrapped
       in newspapers. There were instances of officers taking off
       their shirts that the little bodies should not go naked. A
       telegram was at once despatched to Paris for food and
       clothes and hospital supplies. Twenty-four cars came through
       within a week, despite the unusual military traffic. This
       ends the list of what was accomplished by two men in one
       day.</p>

    <p>The great thing was to make the demoralised Italians feel
    that America was on the spot and helping them. The sending of
    troops could not have reused their fighting spirit. They were
    sick of fighting. What they needed was the assurance that the
    world was not wholly brutal&mdash;that there was some one who
    was merciful, who did not condemn and who was moved by their
    sorrow. This assurance the prompt action of the American Red
    Cross gave. It restored in the affirmative with mercy,
    precisely the quality which Hun fury and propaganda had
    destroyed with lies. It restored to them their belief in the
    nobility of mankind, out of which belief grows all true
    courage.</p>

    <p>As the work progressed, it branched out on a much larger
    scale, embracing civilian, military and child-welfare
    activities. In the month of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"
       id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span> November upward of half a
       million lire were placed in the hands of American consuls
       for distribution. One million lire were contributed for the
       benefit of soldiers' families. A permanent headquarters was
       established with trained business men and men who had had
       experience under Hoover in Belgium in charge of its
       departments. Over 100 hospitals and two principal magazines
       of hospital stores had been lost in the retreat. The
       American Red Cross made up this deficiency by supplying the
       bedding for no less than 3,000 beds. Five weeks after the
       first two representatives had reached Rome three complete
       ambulance sections, each section being made up of 20
       ambulances, a staff car, a kitchen trailer and 33 men, were
       turned over to the Italian Medical Service of the third
       Army. By the first week in December the stream of refugees
       had practically stopped. Italy had been made to realise that
       she was not fighting alone; her morale had returned to her.
       This work, which had been initially undertaken from purely
       altruistic motives, had proved to possess a value of the
       highest military importance&mdash;an importance of the
       spirit utterly out of proportion to the money and labour
       expended. Magnanimity arouses magnanimity. In this case it
       revived the flame of Garibaldi which had all but died. It
       achieved a strategic victory
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"
       id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span> of the soul which no amount
       of military assistance could have accomplished. The victory
       of the American Red Cross on the Italian Front is all the
       more significant since it was not until months later that
       Congress declared war on Austria.</p>

    <p>The campaign which the American Red Cross is waging in every
    country in which it operates, is frankly an "out to win"
    campaign. To win the war is its one and only object. What the
    army does for the courage of the body, the Red Cross does for
    the courage of the mind. It builds up the hearts and hopes of
    people who in three and a half years have grown numb. It
    restores the human touch to their lives and, with it, the
    spiritual horizon. Its business, while the army is still
    preparing, is to bring home to the Allies in every possible way
    the fact that America, with her hundred and ten millions of
    population, is in the war with them, eager to play the game,
    anxious to sacrifice as they have sacrificed, to give her
    man-power and resources as they have done, until justice has
    been established for every man and nation.</p>

    <p>It is necessary to lay stress on this programme since it
    differs greatly from the popular conception of the functions of
    the Red Cross in the battle area. It was on the field of
    Solferino in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"
       id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span> 1859, that Henri Dunant
       went out before the fury had spent itself to tend the
       wounded. It was here that he was fired with his great
       ambition to found a non-combatant service, which should
       recognise no enemies and be friends with every army. His
       ambition was realised when in 1864 the Conference at Geneva
       chose the Swiss flag, reversed, as its emblem&mdash;a red
       cross on a field of white&mdash;and laid the foundations for
       those international understandings which have since formed
       for all combatants, except the Hun in this present warfare,
       the protective law for the sick and wounded. The original
       purpose of the Red Cross still fills the imagination of the
       masses to the exclusion of all else that it is doing.
       Directly the term "Red Cross" is mentioned the picture that
       forms in most men's minds is of ambulances galloping through
       the thick of battle-smoke and of devoted stretcher-bearers
       who brave danger not to kill, but in order that they may
       save lives.</p>

    <p>This war has changed all that. To-day the Red Cross has to
    minister to not the wounded of armies only, but to the wounded
    of nations. In a country like France, with trenches dug the
    entire length of her eastern frontier and vast territories from
    which the entire population has been evacuated, the wounds of
    her armies are small in comparison with the wounds, bodily and
    mental, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"
       id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span> of her civil
       population&mdash;wounds which are the outcome of over three
       years of privation. When the civil population of any country
       has lost its pluck, no matter how splendid the spirit of its
       soldiers, its armies become paralysed. The civilians can
       commence peace negotiations behind the backs of their men in
       the trenches. They can insist on peace by refusing to send
       them ammunition and supplies. As a matter of fact the morale
       of the soldiers varies directly with the morale of the
       civilians for whom they fight. Behind every soldier stand a
       woman and a group of children. Their safety is his
       inspiration. If they are neglected, his sacrifice is
       belittled. If they beg that he should lay down his arms, his
       determination is weakened. It is therefore a vital
       necessity, quite apart from the humanitarian aspect, that
       the wounds of the civilians of belligerent countries should
       be cared for. If the civilians are allowed to become
       disheartened and cowardly, the heroic ideal of their
       fighting-men is jeopardised. This fact has been recognised
       by the Red Cross Societies of all countries in the present
       war; a large part of their energies has been devoted to
       social and relief work of a civil nature. Even in their
       purely military departments, the comfort of the troops
       claims quite as much attention as their medical treatment
       and hospitalisation. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"
       id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span> As a matter of fact, the
       actual carrying of the wounded out of the trenches to the
       comparative safety of the dressing station is usually done
       by combatants. A man has to live continually under
       shell-fire to acquire the immunity to fear which passes for
       courage. The bravest man is likely to get "jumpy," if he
       only faces up to a bombardment occasionally. There are other
       reasons why combatants should do the stretcher-bearing which
       do not need elaborating. The combatants have an expert
       knowledge of their own particular frontage; they are "wise"
       to the barraged areas; they are "up front" and continually
       coming and going, so it is often an economy of man-power for
       them to attend to their own wounded in the initial stages;
       they are the nearest to a comrade when he falls and all
       carry the necessary first-aid dressings; the emblem of the
       Red Cross has proved to be only a slight protection, as the
       Hun is quite likely not to respect it. What I am driving at
       is that the Red Cross has had to adapt itself to the new
       conditions of modern warfare, so that very many of its most
       important present-day functions are totally different from
       what popular fancy imagines.</p>

    <p>The American Red Cross has its French Headquarters in a
    famous gambling club in the Place de la Concorde. It is
    somewhat strange to pass
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"
       id="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span> through these rooms where
       rakes once flung away fortunes, and to find them
       industriously orderly with the conscience of an imported
       nation. By far the larger part of the staff are business men
       of the Wall Street type&mdash;not at all the kind who have
       been accustomed to sentimentalise over philanthropy. There
       is also a sprinkling of trained social workers, clergy,
       journalists, and university professors. The medical
       profession is represented by some of the leading specialists
       of the States, but at Headquarters they are distinctly in
       the minority. The purely medical work of the American Red
       Cross forms only a part of its total activities. The men at
       the head of affairs are bankers, merchants, presidents of
       corporations&mdash;men who have been trained to think in
       millions and to visualise broad areas. Girls are very much
       in evidence. They are usually volunteers, drawn from all
       classes, who offered their services to do anything that
       would help. To-day they are typists, secretaries,
       stenographers, nurses.</p>

    <p>The organisation is divided into three main departments: the
    department of military affairs, of civil affairs and of
    administration. Under these departments come a variety of
    bureaus: the bureau of rehabilitation and reconstruction; of
    the care and prevention of tuberculosis; of needy children and
    infant mortality; of refugees and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"
       id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span> relief; of the re-education
       of the French mutilés; of supplies; of the rolling canteens
       for the French armies; of the U.S. Army Division; of the
       Military, Medical and Surgical Division, etc. They are too
       numerous to mention in detail. The best way I can convey the
       picture of immense accomplishment is to describe what I
       actually saw in the field of operations.</p>

    <p>The first place I will take you to is Evian, because here
    you see the tragedy and need of France as embodied in
    individuals. Evian-les-Bains is on Lake Geneva, looking out
    across the water to Switzerland. It is the first point of call
    across the French frontier for the repatriés returning from
    their German bondage. When the Boche first swept down on the
    northern provinces he pushed the French civilian population
    behind him. He has since kept them working for him as serfs,
    labouring in the captured coal-mines, digging his various lines
    of defences, setting up wire-entanglements, etc. Apart from the
    testimony of repatriated French civilians, I myself have seen
    messages addressed by Frenchmen to their wives, scrawled
    surreptitiously on the planks of Hun dug-outs in the hope that
    one day the dug-outs would be captured, and the messages passed
    on by a soldier of the Allies. After three and a half years of
    enforced labour, many of these captured
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"
       id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span> civilians are worked out.
       To the Boche, with his ever-increasing food-shortage, they
       represent useless mouths. Instead of filling them he is
       driving their owners back, broken and useless, by way of
       Switzerland. To him human beings are merchandise to be sold
       upon the hoof like cattle. No spiritual values enter into
       the bargain. When the body is exhausted it is sent to the
       knacker's, as though it belonged to a worn-out horse. The
       entire attitude is materialistic and degrading.
       Evian-les-Bains, the once gay gambling resort of the
       cosmopolitan, has become the knacker's shop for French
       civilians exhausted by their German servitude. The Hun
       shoves them across the border at the rate of about 1,300 a
       day. From the start I have always felt that this war was a
       crusade; what I saw at Evian made me additionally certain.
       When I was in the trenches I never had any hatred of the
       Boche. Probably I shall lose my hatred in pity for him when
       I get to the Front again&mdash;but for the present I hate
       him. It's here in France that one sees what a vileness he
       has created in the children's and women's lives.</p>

    <p>I took the night train down from Paris. Early in the morning
    I woke up to find myself in the gorges of the Alps, high peaks
    with romantic Italian-looking settings soaring on every side.
    At <span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"
       id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span> noon we reached Lake
       Geneva, lying slate-coloured and sombre beneath a wintry
       sky. That afternoon I saw the train of repatriés arrive.</p>

    <p>I was on the platform when the train pulled into the
    station. It might have been a funeral cortége, only there was a
    horrible difference: the corpses pretended to be alive. The
    American Ambulance men were there in force. They climbed into
    the carriages and commenced to help the infirm to alight. The
    exiles were all so stiff with travel that they could scarcely
    move at first. The windows of the train were grey with faces.
    Such faces! All of them old, even the little children's. The
    Boche makes a present to France of only such human wreckage as
    is unuseful for his purposes. He is an acute man of business.
    The convoy consisted of two classes of persons&mdash;the very
    ancient and the very juvenile. You can't set a man of eighty to
    dig trenches and you can't make a prostitute out of a
    girl-child of ten. The only boys were of the mal-nourished
    variety. Men, women and children&mdash;they all had the
    appearance of being half-witted.</p>

    <p>They were terribly pathetic. As I watched them I tried to
    picture to myself what three and a half long years of captivity
    must have meant. How often they must have dreamt of the
    exaltation of this day&mdash;and now that it had arrived,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"
       id="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span> they were not exalted. They
       had the look of people so spiritually benumbed that they
       would never know despair or exaltation again. They had a
       broken look; their shoulders were crushed and their skirts
       bedraggled. Many of them carried babies&mdash;pretty little
       beggars with flaxen hair. It wasn't difficult to guess their
       parentage.</p>

    <p>As they were herded on the platform a low, strangled kind of
    moaning went up. I watched individual lips to see where the
    sound came from. I caught no movement. The noise was the
    sighing of tired animals. Every one had some treasured
    possession. Here was an old man with an alarm-clock; there an
    aged woman with an empty bird-cage. A boy carried half-a-dozen
    sauce-pans strung together. Another had a spare pair of patched
    boots under his arm. Quite a lot of them clutched a bundle of
    umbrellas. I found myself reflecting that these were the
    remnants of families who had been robbed of everything that
    they valued in the world. Whatever they had saved from the ruin
    ought to represent the possession which had claimed most of
    their affections, and yet&mdash;! What did an alarm-clock, an
    empty bird-cage, a pair of patched boots, a string of
    sauce-pans, a bundle of ragged umbrellas signify in any life?
    What <span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"
       id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span> utter poverty, if these
       were the best that they could save!</p>

    <p>There was a band on the platform, consisting mainly of
    bugles and drums, to welcome them. The leader is reputed to be
    the laziest man in the French Army. It is said that they tried
    him at everything and then, in despair, sent him to Evian to
    drum forgotten happiness into the bones of repatriés. Whatever
    his former military record, he now does his utmost to
    impersonate the defiant and impassioned soul of France. His
    moustaches are curled fiercely. His brows are heavy as
    thunderclouds. When he drums, the veins swell out in his neck
    with the violence of his energy.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, with an ominous preliminary rumble, the band
    struck up the Marseillaise. You should have seen the change in
    this crowd of corpses. You must remember that these people had
    been so long accustomed to lies and snares that it would
    probably take days to persuade them that they were actually
    safe home in France.</p>

    <p>As the battle-song for which they had suffered shook the air
    their lips rustled like leaves. There was hardly any
    sound&mdash;only a hoarse whisper. Then, all of a sudden, words
    came&mdash;an inarticulate, sobbing commotion. Tears blinded
    the eyes of every spectator, even those who had witnessed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"
       id="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span> similar scenes often; we
       were crying because the singing was so little human.</p>

    <p>"Vive la France! Vive la France!" They waved flags&mdash;not
    the tri-colour, but flags which had been given them in
    Switzerland. They clung together dazed, women with slatternly
    dresses, children with peaked faces, men unhappy and unshaven.
    A woman caught sight of my uniform. "Vive l'Angleterre," she
    cried, and they all came stumbling forward to embrace me. It
    was horrible. They creaked like automatons. They gestured and
    mouthed, but the soul had been crushed out of their eyes. You
    don't need any proofs of Hun atrocities; the proofs are to be
    seen at Evian. There are no severed hands, no crucified bodies;
    only hearts that have been mutilated. Sorrow is at its saddest
    when it cannot even contrive to appear dignified. There is no
    dignity about the repatriés at Evian, with their absurd
    umbrellas, sauce-pans, patched-boots, alarm-clocks and
    bird-cages. They do not appeal to one as sacrificed patriots.
    There is no nobility in their vacant stare. They create a cold
    feeling of bodily decay&mdash;only it is the spirit that is
    dead and gangrenous.</p>

    <p>There is a blasphemous story by Leonid Andreyev, which
    recounts the bitterness of the after years of Lazarus and the
    mischief Christ wrought <span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"
       id="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span> in recalling him from the
       grave. After his unnatural return to life there was a
       blueness as of putrescence beneath his pallor; an iciness to
       his touch; a choking silence in his presence; a horror in
       his gaze, as if he were remembering his three days in the
       sepulchre&mdash;as if forbidden knowledge groped behind his
       eyes. He rarely looked at any one; there were none who
       courted his glance, who did not creep away to die. The
       terror of his fame spread beyond Bethany. Rome heard of him,
       and at that safe distance laughed. It did not laugh after
       Cæsar Augustus had sent for him. Cæsar Augustus was a god
       upon earth; he could not die. But when he had questioned
       Lazarus, peeped through the windows of his eyes, and read
       what lay hidden in that forbidden memory, he commanded that
       red-hot irons should quench such sight for ever. From Rome
       Lazarus groped his way back to Palestine and there, long
       years after his Saviour had been crucified, continued to
       stumble through his own particular Gethsemane of blindness.
       I thought of that story in the presence of this crowd, which
       carried with it the taint of the grave.</p>

    <p>But the band was still playing the Marseillaise&mdash;over
    and over it played it. With each repetition it was as though
    these people, three years dead, made another effort to cast
    aside their <span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"
       id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span> shrouds. Little by little
       something was happening&mdash;something wonderful. Backs
       were straightening; skirts were being caught up; resolution
       was rippling from face to face&mdash;it passed and re-passed
       with each new roll of the drums. The hoarse cries and
       moaning with which we had commenced were gradually
       transforming themselves into singing.</p>

    <p>There were some who were too weak to walk; these were
    carried by the American Red Cross men into the waiting
    ambulances. The remainder were marshalled into a disorderly
    procession and led out of the station by the band.</p>

    <p>We were moving down the hill to the palaces beside the
    lake&mdash;the palaces to which all France used to troop for
    pleasure. We moved soddenly at first, shuffling in our steps.
    But the drums were still rolling out their defiance and the
    bugles were still blowing. The laziest man in the French Army
    was doing his utmost to belie his record. The ill-shod,
    flattened feet took up the music. They began to dance. Were
    there ever feet less suited to dancing? That they should dance
    was the acme of tragedy. Stockings fell down in creases about
    the ankles. Women commenced to jig their Boche babies in their
    arms; consumptive men and ancients waved their sauce-pans and
    grotesque bundles of umbrellas. The sight was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"
       id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span> damnable. It was a
       burlesque. It pierced the heart. What right had the Boche to
       leave these people so comic after he had squeezed the
       life-blood out of them?</p>

    <p>All his insults to humanity became suddenly typified in
    these five hundred jumping tatterdemalions&mdash;the way in
    which he had plundered the world of its youth, its cleanness,
    its decency. I felt an anger which battlefields had never
    aroused, where men moulder above ground and become unsightly
    beneath the open sky. The slain of battlefields were at least
    motionless; they did not gape and grin at you with the dreadful
    humour of these perambulating dead. I felt the Galilean passion
    which animates every Red Cross worker at Evian: the agony to do
    something to make these murdered people live again. This last
    convoy came, I discovered, from a city behind the Boche lines
    against which last summer I had often directed fire. It was
    full in sight from my observing station. I had watched the very
    houses in which these people, who now walked beside me, had
    sheltered. For three and a half years these women's bodies had
    been at the Hun's mercy. I tried to bring the truth home to
    myself. Their men and young girls had been left behind. They
    themselves had been flung back on overburdened France only
    because <span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"
       id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span> they were no longer
       serviceable. They were returning actually penniless, though
       seemingly with money. The thrifty German makes a practice of
       seizing all the good redeemable French money of the
       repatriés before he lets them escape him, giving them in
       exchange worthless paper stuff of his own manufacture, which
       has no security behind it and is therefore not
       negotiable.</p>

    <p>We came to the Casino, where endless formalities were
    necessary. First of all in the big hall, formerly devoted to
    gambling, the repatriés were fed at long tables. As I passed,
    odd groups seeing my uniform, hurriedly dropped whatever they
    were doing and, removing their caps, stood humbly at attention.
    There was fear in their promptness. Where they came from an
    officer exacted respect with the flat of his sword. What a
    dumb, helpless jumble of humanity! It was as though the
    occupants of a morgue had become galvanised and had temporarily
    risen from their slabs.</p>

    <p>The band had been augmented by trumpets. It took its place
    in the gallery and deluged the hall with patriotic fervour. An
    old man climbed on a table and yelled, "Vive La France!" But
    they had grown tired of shouting; they soon grew tired. The cry
    was taken up faintly and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"
       id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span> soon exhausted itself.
       Nothing held their attention for long. Most of them sat
       hunched up and inert, weakly crying. They were not
       beautiful. They were not like our men who die in battle.
       They were animated memories of horror. "What lies before us?
       What lies before us?" That was the question that their
       silence asked perpetually. Some of them had husbands with
       the French army; others had sweethearts. What would those
       men say to the flaxen-haired babies who nestled against the
       women's breasts? And the sin was not theirs&mdash;they were
       such tired, pretty mites. "What lies before us?" The babies,
       too, might well have asked that question. Do you wonder that
       I at last began to share the Frenchman's hatred for the
       Boche?</p>

    <p>An extraordinary person in a white tie, top hat and evening
    dress entered. He looked like a cross between Mr. Gerard's
    description of himself in Berlin and a head-waiter. He
    evidently expected his advent to cause a profound sensation. I
    found out why: he was the official welcomer to Evian. Twice a
    day, for an infinity of days, he had entered in solemn fashion,
    faced the same tragic assembly, made the same fiery oration,
    gained applause at the climax of the same rounded periods and
    allowed his voice to break in the same rightly timed places.
    Having <span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"
       id="page131"></a>[pg 131]</span> kept his audience in
       sufficient suspense as regards his mission, he unwrapped the
       muffler from his neck, removed his coat, felt his throat to
       see whether it was in good condition, swelled out his chest,
       including his waist-coat which was spanned by the broad
       ribbon of his office, then let loose the painter of his
       emotion and slipped off into the mid-stream of perfunctory
       eloquence. With all his disrobing he had retained his
       top-hat; he held it in his right hand with the brim pressed
       against his thigh, very much in the manner of a showman at a
       circus. It contributed largely to the opulence of his
       gestures.</p>

    <p>He always seemed to have concluded and was always starting
    up afresh, as if in reluctant response to spectral clapping. He
    called upon the repatriés never to forget the crimes that had
    been wrought against them&mdash;to spread abroad the fire of
    their indignation, the story of their ravished womanhood and
    broken families all over France. They watched him leaden-eyed
    and wept softly. To forget, to forget, that was all that they
    wanted&mdash;to blot out all the past. This man with the
    top-hat and the evening-dress, he hadn't suffered&mdash;how
    could he understand? They didn't want to remember; with those
    flaxen-haired children against their breasts the one boon they
    craved <span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"
       id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span> was forgetfulness. And so
       they cowered and wept softly. It was intolerable.</p>

    <p>And now the formalities commenced. They all had to be
    medically examined. Questions of every description were asked
    them. They were drifted from bureau to bureau where people sat
    filling up official blanks. The Americans see to the children.
    They come from living in cellars, from conditions which are
    insanitary, from cities in the army zones where they were
    underfed. The fear is that they may spread contagion all over
    France. When infectious cases are found the remnants of
    families have to be broken up afresh. The mothers collapse on
    benches sobbing their hearts out as their children are led
    away. For three and a half years everything they have loved has
    been led away&mdash;how can they believe that these Americans
    mean only mercy?</p>

    <p>From three to four hours are spent in completing all these
    necessary investigations. Before the repatriés are conducted to
    their billets, all their clothes have to be disinfected and
    every one has to be bathed. The poor people are utterly worn
    out by the end of it&mdash;they have already done a continuous
    four days' journey in cramped trains. Before being sent to
    France they have been living for from two to three weeks in
    Belgium. The Hun always sends the repatriés to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"
       id="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span> Belgium for a few weeks
       before returning them. The reason for this is that they for
       the most part come from the army zones, and a few weeks will
       make any information they possess out of date. Another
       reason is that food is more plentiful in Belgium, thanks to
       the Allies' Relief Commission. These people have been kept
       alive on sugar-beets for the past few months, so it is as
       well to feed them at the Allies' expense for a little while,
       in order that they may create a better impression when they
       return to France. The American doctors pointed out to me the
       pulpy flesh of the children and the distended stomachs
       which, to the unpractised eye, seemed a sign of
       over-nourishment. "Wind and water," they said; "that's all
       these children are. They've no stamina. Sugar-beets are the
       most economic means of just keeping the body and the soul
       together."</p>

    <p>The lights are going out in the Casino. It is the hour when,
    in the old days, life would be becoming most feverish about the
    gaming tables. In little forlorn groups the repatriés are being
    conducted to their temporary quarters in the town. To-morrow
    morning before it is light, another train-load will arrive, the
    band will again play the Marseillaise, the American Red Cross
    workers will again be in attendance, the gentleman
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"
       id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span> in the top-hat and
       white-tie will again make his fiery oration of welcome, his
       audience will again pay no attention but will weep
       softly&mdash;the tediously heart-rending scene will be
       rehearsed throughout in every detail by an entirely new
       batch of actors. Twice a day, summer and winter, the same
       tragedy is enacted at Evian. It is a continuous,
       never-ending performance.</p>

    <p>Poor people! These whom I have seen, if they have no friends
    to claim them, will re-start their journey to some strange
    department on which they will be billeted as paupers. Here
    again the American Red Cross is doing good work, for it sends
    one of its representatives ahead to see that proper
    preparations have been made for their reception. After they
    have reached their destination, it looks them up from time to
    time to make sure that they are being well cared for.</p>

    <p>If one wants to picture the case of the repatrié in its true
    misery, all he needs to do is to convert it into terms of his
    own mother or grandmother. She has lived all her life in the
    neighbourhood of Vimy, let us say. She was married there and it
    was there that she bore all her children. She and her husband
    have saved money; they are substantial people now and need not
    fear the future. Their sons are gaining their own
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"
       id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span> living; one daughter is
       married, the others are arriving at the marriageable age.
       One day the Hun sweeps down on them. The sons escape to join
       the French army; the girls and their parents stay behind to
       guard their property. They are immediately evacuated from
       Vimy and sent to some city, such as Drocourt, further behind
       the Hun front-line. Here they are gradually robbed of all
       their possessions. At the beginning all their gold is
       confiscated; later even the mattresses upon their beds are
       requisitioned. For three and a half years they are subjected
       to both big and petty tyrannies, till their spirits are so
       broken that fear becomes their predominant emotion. The
       father is led away to work in the mines. One by one the
       daughters are commandeered and sent off into the heart of
       Germany, where it will be no one's business to guard their
       virtue. At last the mother is left with only her youngest
       child. Of her sons who are fighting with the French armies
       she has no knowledge, whether they are living or dead. Then
       one day it is decided by her captors that they have no
       further use for her. They part her from her last remaining
       child and pack her off by way of Belgium and Switzerland
       back to her own country. She arrives at Evian penniless and
       half-witted with the terror of her sorrow. There is no one
       to claim her; the part of
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"
       id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span> France that knew her is all
       behind the German lines. A label is tied to her, as if she
       was a piece of baggage, and she is shipped off to Avignon,
       let us say. She has never been in the South before; it is a
       foreign country to her. Poverty and adversity have broken
       her pride; she has nothing left that will command respect.
       There is nothing left in life to which she can fasten her
       affections. Such utter forlornness is never a welcome sight.
       Is it to be wondered at that the strangers to whom she is
       sent are not always glad to see her? Is it to be wondered at
       that, after her repatriation, she often wilts and dies? Her
       sorrow has the appearance of degradation. Wherever she goes,
       she is a threat and a peril to the fighting morale of the
       civilian population. Yet in her pre-war kindliness and
       security she might have been your mother or mine.</p>

    <p>The American Red Cross, by maintaining contact with such
    people, is keeping them reminded that they are not utterly
    deserted&mdash;that the whole of civilised humanity cares
    tremendously what becomes of them and is anxious to lighten the
    load of their sacrifice.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>I have before me a pile of sworn depositions, made by exiles
    returned from the invaded territories. They are separately
    numbered and dated; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"
       id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span> each bears the name of the
       region or town from which the repatrié came. Here are a few
       extracts which, when pieced together, form a picture of the
       life of captured French civilians behind the German lines. I
       have carefully avoided glaring atrocities. Atrocities are as
       a rule isolated instances, due to isolated causes. They
       occur, but they are not typical of the situation. The real
       Hun atrocity is the attitude towards life which calls
       chivalry sentiment, fair-play a waste of opportunity and
       ruthlessness strength. This attitude is all summed up in the
       one word Prussianism. The repatriés have been Prussianised
       out of their wholesome joy and belief in life; it is this
       that makes them the walking accusations that they are
       to-day. In the following depositions they give some glimpses
       of the calculated processes by which their happiness has
       been murdered.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Lately copper, tin, and zinc have been removed in the
    factories and amongst the traders, and quite recently in
    private houses. For all these requisitions the Germans gave
    Requisition Bonds, but private individuals who received them
    never got paid the money. To force men to work 'voluntarily'
    and sign contracts the Germans employed the following means:
    the Germans gave <span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"
       id="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span> these men nothing to eat,
       but authorised their families to send them parcels; these
       parcels once in the hands of the Germans are shown to these
       unhappy men and are not handed over until they have signed.
       About a week ago young boys from the age of fourteen who had
       come back from the Ardennes had to present themselves at the
       Kdr to be registered anew; a number of the young people work
       in the sawmills, etc.; some have died of privation and
       fatigue."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"A week after Easter this year the population of LILLE was
    warned by poster that all must be ready to leave the town. At
    three o'clock in the morning private houses were invaded by the
    German soldiers; they sorted out women and girls who were to be
    deported. There then took place scandalous scenes: young girls
    belonging to the most worthy families in the town had to pass
    medical visits even with the speculum and had to endure most
    atrocious physical and moral suffering. These young girls were
    segregated like beasts anywhere in the rooms of the town halls
    and schoolhouses, and were mingled with the dregs of the
    population."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"For a certain time the Germans did not requisition milk and
    allowed it to be sold, but now this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"
       id="page139"></a>[pg 139]</span> is forbidden under a fine
       of 1,000 marks or three months' imprisonment. Recently
       WIGNEHIES was fined 100,000 frcs., and as the whole of this
       sum was not paid the Germans inflicted punishment as
       follows: Several inhabitants of WIGNEHIES were caught in the
       act of disobeying by the gendarmes and were struck, and
       bitten by the police dogs of the gendarmes because they
       refused to denounce the sellers.... Brutal treatment is due
       more to the gendarmes than to the soldiers. About six weeks
       ago Marceau Horlet of WIGNEHIES was found, on a search by
       the gendarmes, to have a piece of meat in his possession. He
       was brutally beaten by them and bitten by the police dogs
       because he refused to say who had given it to him. In 1915,
       the youth Rémy Valléi of WIGNEHIES, age 15, was walking in
       the street after 6-9 p.m., which was forbidden; he was seen
       by two gendarmes and ran away. He was straightway killed,
       receiving six revolver bullets in his body."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"At PIGNICOURT during the CHAMPAGNE offensive the village
    was bombarded by the French, who were attempting to destroy the
    railway lines and bridges. The Commandant, by name Krama, of
    the Kdr, forced men and youths, and even women, to fill up the
    holes made by the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"
       id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span> bombardment during the
       action. A German general passed and reprimanded them on the
       ground that there was danger to the civilians; they were
       withdrawn for the moment, but sent back as soon as the
       general had left."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"As regards the Hispano-American revictualling, it may be
    said with truth that without this the population of Northern
    France would have died of hunger, for the Germans considered
    themselves liberated from any responsibility. During the first
    months of the war before this Committee started, the Germans
    put up posters saying that the Allies were trying to starve
    Germany, who in turn was not obliged to feed the invaded
    territory.... When informant (who is from ST. QUENTIN) left at
    the general evacuation of this town, no requisition bonds were
    given for household goods. As the inhabitants left, their
    furniture was loaded on to motor lorries and taken to the
    station, whence it was sent by special train to Germany. This
    shows clearly that requisition bonds issued by the Germans show
    only the small proportion of what has been suffered by the
    inhabitants.... Informant was the witness of the execution of
    French civilians whose only fault was either to hide arms or
    pigeons: several who had committed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"
       id="page141"></a>[pg 141]</span> these infractions of
       requisitions were shot, and the Germans announced the fact
       by poster of a blood-red colour. In other cases the men shot
       were British prisoners who had dressed in civil clothes on
       the arrival of the Germans. Informant had a long
       conversation with one of them before his execution. He told
       informant how he had been unable to leave ST. QUENTIN, viz.,
       by the 28th August. Some passers-by offered to hide him. It
       appears that, through his ignorance of the French language,
       he was unaware that the Germans threatened execution to all
       men found after a certain date. He was discovered and
       condemned to death for espionage. It is obvious, as the man
       himself said, that one could not imagine a man acting as a
       spy without knowing either the language of the country or
       that of the enemy."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Before the evacuation of the population the Germans chose
    those who were to remain as civilian workers, viz., 120 men
    from 15 to 60. On the very day of the evacuation they kept back
    at the station 27 others. These men are now at CANTIN or
    SOMAIN, where they are employed on the roads or looking after
    munitions in the Arras group. The others at DECHY and GUESNIN
    are in the VIMY group and are making pill-boxes or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"
       id="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span> railway lines. A certain
       number of these workers refused to carry out the work
       ordered, and as punishment during the summer were tied to
       chairs and exposed bareheaded to the full blaze of the sun.
       They were often threatened to be shot."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"After the bombardment of LILLE the Germans entered
    ENNETIÈRES on the 12th October, 1914. On the next Monday 200
    Uhlans occupied the Commune, and houses and haystacks were
    burned.... At LOMME every one was forced to work: the Saxon
    Kdnt. Schoper announced that all women who did not obey within
    24 hours would be interned: all the women obeyed. They were
    employed in the making of osier-revêtement two metres high for
    the trenches. The men were forced to put up barbed wire near
    Fort Denglas, two kltrs. from the front. A few days after the
    evacuation of ENNETIÈRES the Uhlans shot a youth, Jean
    Leclercq, age 17, son of the gardener of Count D'Hespel, simply
    because they had found a telephone wire in the courtyard of the
    château."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"Informant, who has lost his right arm, was nevertheless
    forced to work for the Germans, notably to unload coal and to
    work on the roads. He had with him males from 13 to 60. Having
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"
       id="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span> objected because of his
       lost arm, he was threatened with imprisonment. At LOMME
       squads of workers were given the work of putting up barbed
       wire; women were forced to make sand bags. In cases of
       refusal on either side the Kdr. inflicted four or five
       weeks' imprisonment, to say nothing of blows with sticks
       inflicted by the soldiers. In spring 1917 a number of men
       were sent from LOMME to the BEAUVIN-PROVINS region to work
       on defences.... Those who refused to sign were threatened
       and struck with the butts of rifles, and left in cellars
       sometimes filled with water during bombardments. Several of
       them came back seriously ill from privation."</p>

    <p>"Young girls are separated from their mothers; there are
    levies made at every moment. Sometimes these young girls have
    barely a few hours before the moment of departure.... Several
    young girls have written to say that they are very unhappy and
    that they sleep in camps amongst girls of low class and
    condition."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"For a long time past women have been forced to work as road
    labourers. These work in the quarries and transport wood cut
    down by the men in the mountain forest. A number of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"
       id="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span> women and young girls have
       been removed from their families and sent in the direction
       of RHEIMS and RETHEL, where it is said (although this cannot
       be confirmed) that they are employed in aerodromes."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>These extracts should serve to explain the mental and
    physical depression of the returning exiles. They have been
    bullied out of the desire to live and out of all possession of
    either their bodies or their souls. They have been treated like
    cattle, and as cattle they have come to regard themselves.
    Lazaruses&mdash;that's what they are! The unmerciful Boche,
    having killed and buried them, drags them out from the tomb and
    compels them to go through the antics of life. Le Gallienne's
    poem comes to my mind:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Loud mockers in the angry street</p>

            <p>Say Christ is crucified again&mdash;</p>

            <p>Twice pierced those gospel-bearing feet,</p>

            <p>Twice broken that great heart in vain...."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>That is all true at Evian. But when I see the American men
    and girls, leaning over the Boche babies in their cots and
    living their hearts into the hands and feet of the spiritually
    maimed, the last two lines of the poem become true for
    me:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"
       id="page145"></a>[pg 145]</span>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"I hear, and to myself I say,</p>

            <p>'Why, Christ walks with me every day.'"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The work of the American Red Cross at Evian is largely
    devoted to children. It provides all the ambulance
    transportation for the repatriés, to and from the station.
    American doctors and nurses do all the examining of the
    children at the Casino. On an average, four hundred pass
    through their hands daily. The throat, nose, teeth, glands and
    skin of each child are inspected. If the child is suspected or
    attacked by any disease, it is immediately segregated and sent
    to the American hospital. If the infection is only local or
    necessitates further examination, the child and its family are
    summoned to present themselves at the American dispensary next
    day. Every precaution is employed to prevent the spread of
    infection&mdash;particularly the infection of tuberculosis.
    Evian is the gateway from Germany through which disease and
    death may be carried to the furthest limits of France. Very few
    of the repatriés are really healthy. It would be a wonder if
    they were after the privations through which they have passed.
    All of them are weakened in vitality and broken down in
    stamina. Many of them have no homes to go to and have to be
    sent to departments of the interior
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"
       id="page146"></a>[pg 146]</span> and the south. If they were
       sent in an unhealthy condition, it would mean the spread of
       epidemics.</p>

    <p>The Red Cross has a large children's hospital at Evian in
    the villas and buildings of the Hôtel Chatelêt. This hospital
    deals with the contagious cases. It has others, especially one
    at the Château des Halles, thirty kilometers from Lyons, which
    take the devitalised, convalescent and tubercular cases. The
    Château des Halles is a splendidly built modern building,
    arranged in an ideal way for hospital use. It stands at the
    head of a valley, with an all day sun exposure and large
    grounds. Close to the Château are a number of small villages in
    which it is possible to lodge the repatriés in families. This
    is an important part of the repatrié's problem, as after their
    many partings they fight fiercely against any further
    separations. One of the chief reasons for having the
    Convalescent Hospital out in the country is that families can
    be quartered in the villages and so kept together.</p>

    <p>The pathetic hunger of these people for one another after
    they have been so long divided, was illustrated for me on my
    return journey to Paris. A man of the tradesman class had been
    to Evian to meet his wife and his boy of about eleven. They
    were among the lucky ones, for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"
       id="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span> they had a home to go to.
       He was not prepossessing in appearance. He had a weak face,
       lined with anxiety, broken teeth and limp hair. His wife, as
       so often happens in French marriages, had evidently been the
       manageress. She was unbeautiful in rusty black; her clothes
       were the ill-assorted make-shifts of the civilian who
       escapes from Germany. Her eyes were shifty with the habit of
       fear and sunken with the weariness of crying. The boy was a
       bright little fellow, full of defiance and anecdotes of his
       recent captors.</p>

    <p>When I entered the carriage, they were sitting huddled
    together&mdash;the man in the middle, with an arm about either
    of them. He kept pressing them to him, kissing them by turn in
    a spasmodic unrestrained fashion, as if he still feared that he
    might lose them and could not convince himself of the happy
    truth that they were once again together. The woman did not
    respond to his embraces; she seemed indifferent to him,
    indifferent to life, indifferent to any prospects. The boy
    seemed fond of his father, but embarrassed by his starved
    demonstrativeness.</p>

    <p>I listened to their conversation. The man's talk was all of
    the future&mdash;what splendid things he would do for them.
    How, as long as they lived, he would never waste a moment from
    their sides. It appeared that he had been at Tours, on
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"
       id="page148"></a>[pg 148]</span> a business trip when the
       war broke out, and could not get back to Lille before the
       Germans arrived there. For three and a half years he had
       lived in suspense, while everything he loved had lain behind
       the German lines. The woman contributed no suggestions to
       his brilliant plans. She clung to him, but she tried to
       divert his affection. When she spoke it was of small
       domestic abuses: the exorbitant prices she had had to pay
       for food; the way in which the soldiery had stolen her pots
       and pans; the insolence she had experienced when she had
       lodged complaints against the men before their officers. And
       the boy&mdash;he wanted to be a poilu. He kept inventing
       revenges he would take in battle, if the war lasted long
       enough for his class to be called out. As darkness fell they
       ceased talking. I began to realise that in three and a half
       years they had lost contact. They were saying over and over
       the things that had been said already; they were trying to
       prevent themselves from acknowledging that they had grown
       different and separate. The only bond which held them as a
       family was their common loneliness and fear that, if they
       did not hold together, their intolerable loneliness would
       return. When the light was hooded, the boy sank his hand
       against his father's shoulder; the woman nestled herself in
       the fold of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"
       id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span> his arm, with her head
       turned away from him, that he might not kiss her so often.
       The man sat upright, his eyes wide open, watching them
       sleeping with a kind of impotent despair. They were
       together; and yet they were not together. He had recovered
       them; nevertheless, he had not recovered them. Those Boches,
       the devils, they had kept something; they had only sent
       their bodies back. All night long, whenever I woke up as the
       train halted, the little man was still guarding them
       jealously as a dog guards a bone, and staring morosely at
       the blank wall of the future.</p>

    <p>These were among the lucky ones; the boy and woman had had a
    man to meet them. Somewhere in France there was protection
    awaiting them and the shelter of a house that was not charity.
    And yet ... all night while they slept the man sat awake,
    facing up to facts. These were among the lucky ones! That is
    Evian; that is the tragedy and need of France as you see it
    embodied in individuals.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The total number of repatriés and réfugiés now in France is
    said to total a million and a half. The repatriés are the
    French civilians who were captured by the Germans in their
    advance and have since been sent back. The réfugiés are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"
       id="page150"></a>[pg 150]</span> the French civilians from
       the devastated areas, who have always remained on the
       Allies' side of the line. The réfugiés are divided into two
       classes: réfugiés proper&mdash;that is fugitives from the
       front, who fled for the most part at the time of the German
       invasion; and évacués&mdash;those who were sent out of the
       war zone by the military authorities. Naturally a large
       percentage of this million and a half have lost everything
       and, irrespective of their former worldly position, now live
       with the narrowest margin between themselves and starvation.
       The French Government has treated them with generosity, but
       in the midst of a war it has had little time to devote to
       educating them into being self-supporting. A great number of
       funds have been privately raised for them in France; many
       separate organisations for their relief have been started.
       The American Red Cross is making this million and a half
       people its special care, and to do so is co-operating
       directly with the French Government and with existing French
       civilian projects. Its action is dictated by mercy and
       admiration, but in results this policy is the most
       far-seeing statesmanship. A million and a half plundered
       people, if neglected and allowed to remain downhearted, are
       likely to constitute a danger to the morale of the bravest
       nation. Again, from the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page151"
       id="page151"></a>[pg 151]</span> point of view of after-war
       relations, to have been generous towards those who have
       suffered is to have won the heart of France. The caring for
       the French repatriates and refugees is a definite
       contribution to the winning of the war.</p>

    <p>The French system of handling this human stream of tragedy
    is to send the sick to local hospitals and the exhausted to the
    <i>maison de repos</i>. The comparatively healthy are allowed
    to be claimed by friends; the utterly homeless are sent to some
    prefecture remote from the front-line. The prefects in turn
    distribute them among towns and villages, lodging them in old
    barracks, casinos and any buildings which war-conditions have
    made vacant. The adults are allowed by the Government a franc
    and a half per day, and the children seventy-five centimes.</p>

    <p>The armies have drained France of her doctors since the war;
    until the Americans came, the available medical attention was
    wholly inadequate to the civilian population. The American Red
    Cross is now establishing dispensaries through the length and
    breadth of France. In country districts, inaccessible to towns,
    it is inaugurating automobile-dispensaries which make their
    rounds on fixed and advertised days. In addition to this it has
    started a child-welfare movement, the aim of which is to build
    up the birth-rate and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page152"
       id="page152"></a>[pg 152]</span> lower the infant mortality
       by spreading the right kind of knowledge among the women and
       girls.</p>

    <p>The condition of the refugees and repatriates, thrust into
    communities to which they came as paupers and crowded into
    buildings which were never planned for domestic purposes, has
    been far from enviable. In September, 1917, the American Red
    Cross handed over the solving of this problem to one of its
    experts who had organised the aid given to San Francisco after
    the earthquake, and who had also had charge of the relief-work
    necessitated by the Ohio floods at Dayton. Co-operating with
    the French, houses partially constructed at the outbreak of war
    were now completed and furnished, and approximately three
    thousand families were supplied with homes and privacy. The
    start made proved satisfactory. Supplies, running into millions
    of francs, were requisitioned, and the plan for getting the
    people out of public buildings into homes was introduced to the
    officials of most of the departments of France. Delegates were
    sent out by the Red Cross to undertake the organisation of the
    work. Money was apportioned for the supplying of destitute
    families with furniture and the instruments of trade; the
    object in view was not to pauperise them, but to afford them
    the opportunity for becoming self-supporting.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"
       id="page153"></a>[pg 153]</span> Re-construction work in
       those devastated areas which have been won back from the
       Boche was hurried forward in order that the people who had
       been uprooted from the soil might be returned to it and, in
       being returned to their own particular soil, might recover
       their place in life and their balance.</p>

    <p>I visited the devastated areas of the Pas-de-Calais, Somme,
    Oise and Aisne and saw what is being accomplished. This
    destroyed territory is roughly one hundred miles long by thirty
    miles broad at its widest point. In 1912 one-quarter of the
    wheat produced in France and eighty-seven per cent. of the beet
    crop employed in the national industry of sugar-making, were
    raised in these departments of the north. The invasion has
    diminished the national wheat production by more than a half.
    It is obvious, then, that in getting these districts once more
    under cultivation two birds are being killed with one stone:
    the refugee is being made a self-supporting person&mdash;an
    economic asset instead of a dead weight&mdash;and the tonnage
    problem is being solved. If more food is grown behind the
    Western Front, grain-ships can be released for transporting the
    munitions of war from America.</p>

    <p>The French Government had already made a start in this
    undertaking before America came
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"
       id="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span> into the war. As early as
       1914 it voted three hundred million francs and appointed a
       group of <i>sous-préfets</i> to see to the dispensing of it.
       Little by little, as the Huns have been driven back, the
       wealthier inhabitants, whose money was safe in Paris banks,
       have returned to these districts and opened <i>oeuvres</i>
       for the poorer inhabitants. Many of them have lost their
       sons and husbands; they find in their daily labour for
       others worse off than themselves an escape from life-long
       despair. Misfortune is a matter of comparison and contrast.
       We are all of us unhappy or fortunate according to our
       standards of selfishness and our personal interpretation of
       our lot. These patriots are bravely turning their experience
       of sorrow into the materials of service. They can speak the
       one and only word which makes a bond of sympathy between the
       prosperous and the broken-hearted, "I, too, have suffered."
       I came across one such woman in the neighbourhood of
       Villequier-au-Mont. She was a woman of title and a royalist.
       Her estates had been laid waste by the invasion and all her
       men-folk, save her youngest son, were dead. Directly the Hun
       withdrew last spring, she came back to the wilderness which
       had been created and commenced to spend what remained of her
       fortune upon helping her peasants. These
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"
       id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span> peasants had been the
       hewers of wood and drawers of water for the Hun for three
       and a half years. When his armies retreated, they took with
       them the girls and the young men, leaving behind only the
       weaklings, the children and the aged. Word came to the Red
       Cross official of the district that her remaining son had
       been killed in action; he was asked to break the news to
       her. He went out to her ruined village and found her sitting
       among a group of women in the shell of a house, teaching
       them to make garments for their families. She was pleased to
       see him; she was in need of more materials. She had been
       intending to make the journey to see him herself. She was
       full of her work and enthusiastic over the valiance of her
       people. He led her aside and told her. She fell silent. Her
       face quivered&mdash;that was all. Then she completed her
       list of requirements and went back to her women. In living
       to comfort other people's grief, she had no time to nurse
       her own.</p>

    <p>These "oeuvres," or groups of workers, settle down in a
    shattered village or township. The military authorities place
    the township in their charge. They at once commence to get
    roofs on to such houses as still have walls. They supply
    farm-implements, poultry, rabbits, carts, seeds, plants, etc.
    They import materials from Paris
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"
       id="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span> and form sewing classes for
       the women and girls. They encourage the trades-people to
       re-start their shops and lend them the necessary initial
       capital. What is perhaps most valuable, they lure the
       terror-stricken population out of their caves and dug-outs,
       and set them an example of hope and courage. Some of the
       best pioneer work of this sort has been done by the English
       Society of Friends who now, together with the Friends of the
       United States, have become a part of the Bureau of the
       Department of Civil Affairs of the American Red Cross.</p>

    <p>The American Red Cross works through the "oeuvres" which it
    found already operating in the devastated area; it places its
    financial backing at their disposal, its means of motor
    transport and its personnel; it grafts on other "oeuvres,"
    operating in newly taken over villages, in which Americans,
    French and English work side by side for the common welfare; at
    strategic points behind the lines it has established a chain of
    relief warehouses, fully equipped with motor-lorries and cars.
    These warehouses furnish everything that an agricultural people
    starting life afresh can require&mdash;food, clothes, blankets,
    beds, mattresses, stoves, kitchen utensils, reapers, binders,
    mowing-machines, threshing-machines, garden-tools, soap, tooth
    brushes, etc. If you can conceive of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"
       id="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span> yourself as having been a
       prosperous farmer and waking up one morning broken in heart
       and dirty in person, with your barns, live-stock, daughters,
       sons, everything gone&mdash;not a penny left in the
       world&mdash;you can imagine your necessities, and then form
       some picture of the fore-thought that goes to the running of
       a Red Cross warehouse.</p>

    <p>But the poverty of these people is not the worst condition
    that the Red Cross workers have to tackle; money can always
    replace money. Hope, trust, affection and a genial belief in
    the world's goodness cannot be transplanted into another man's
    heart in exchange for bitterness by even the most lavish giver.
    I can think of no modern parallel for their blank despair; the
    only eloquence which approximately expresses it is that of Job,
    centuries old, "Why is light given to a man whose way is hid
    and whom God hath hedged in? My sighing cometh before I eat. My
    roarings are poured out like waters. My harp is turned to
    mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep. I was
    not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet
    trouble came."</p>

    <p>This hell which the Hun has created, beggars any description
    of Dante.<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
       It is still more appalling
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"
       id="page158"></a>[pg 158]</span> to remember that the
       external hell which one sees, does not represent one tithe
       of the dreariness which lies hidden behind the eyes of the
       inhabitants. To imagine amid such scenes is to paralyse
       compassion with agony. The craving, never far from one's
       thoughts, is the age-old desire, "O that one might plead
       with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!"</p>

    <p>I started out on my trip in a staff-car from a city well
    behind the lines. In the first half hour of the journey the
    country was green and pleasant. We passed some cavalry officers
    galloping across a brown field; birds were battling against a
    flurrying wind; high overhead an aeroplane sailed serenely.
    There was a sense of life, motion and exhilaration abroad, but
    only for the first half hour of our journey. Then momentarily a
    depression grew up about us. Fields and trees were becoming
    dead, as if a swarm of locusts had eaten their way across them.
    Greenness was vanishing. Houses were becoming untenanted; there
    were holes in the walls of many of them, through which one
    gained glimpses of the sky. Here, by the road-side, we passed a
    cluster of insignificant graves. Then, almost
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"
       id="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span> without warning, the
       barbed-wire entanglements commenced, and the miles and miles
       of abandoned trenches. This, not a year ago from the day on
       which I write, was the Hun's country. Last spring, in an
       attempt to straighten his line, he retreated from it. Our
       offensives on the Somme had converted his Front into a
       dangerous salient.</p>

    <p>We are slowing down; the road is getting water-logged and
    full of holes. The skull of a dead town grows up on the
    horizon. Even at this distance the light behind empty windows
    glares malevolently like the nothingness in vacant sockets. A
    horror is over everything. The horror is not so much due to the
    destruction as to the total absence of any signs of life. One
    man creeping through the landscape would make it seem more
    kindly. I have been in desolated towns often, but there were
    always the faces of our cheery Tommies to smile out from
    cellars and gaps in the walls. From here life is banished
    utterly. The battle-line has retired eastward; one can hear the
    faint rumble of the guns at times. No civilian has come to
    re-inhabit this unhallowed spot.</p>

    <p>We enter what were once its streets. They are nothing now
    but craters with boards across them. On either side the trees
    lie flat along the ground,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page160"
       id="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span> sawn through within a foot
       of the roots. What landmarks remain are the blackened walls
       of houses, cracked and crashed in by falling roofs. The
       entire place must have been given over to explosion and
       incendiarism before the Huns departed. One stands in awe of
       such completeness of savagery; one begins to understand what
       is meant by the term "frightfulness." As far as eye can
       reach there is nothing to be seen but decayed fangs,
       protruding from a swamp of filth, covered with a green slime
       where water has accumulated. This is not the unavoidable
       ruin of shell-fire. No battle was fought here. The
       demolition was the wanton spite of an enemy who, because he
       could not hold the place, was determined to leave nothing
       serviceable behind. With such masterly thoroughness has he
       done his work that the spot can never be re-peopled. The
       surrounding fields are too poisoned and churned up for
       cultivation. The French Government plans to plant a forest;
       it is all that can be done. As years go by, the kindliness
       of Nature may cause her to forget and cover up the scars of
       hatred with greenness. Then, perhaps, peasant lovers will
       wander here and refashion their dreams of a chivalrous
       world. Our generation will be dead by that time; throughout
       our lives this memorial to "frightfulness" will
       remain.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"
       id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span>

    <p>We have left the town and are out in the open country. It is
    clean and unharried. Man can murder orchards and
    habitations&mdash;the things which man plants and makes; he
    finds it more difficult to strangle the primal gifts of Nature.
    All along by the roadside the cement telegraph-posts have been
    broken off short; some of them lie flat along the ground,
    others hang limply in the bent shape of hairpins. Very often we
    have to make a detour where a steel bridge has been blown up;
    we cross the gulley over an improvised affair of struts and
    planks, and so come back into the main roadway. Every now and
    then we pass steam-tractors at work, ploughing huge fields into
    regular furrows. The French Department of Agriculture purchased
    in America nineteen teams of ten tractors apiece in the autumn
    of last year. The American Red Cross has supplied others. The
    fields of this district are unfenced&mdash;the farmers used to
    live together in villages; so the work is made easy. It is
    possible to throw a number of holdings together and to apply to
    France the same wholesale mechanical means of wheat-growing
    that are employed on the prairies of Canada. All the cattle and
    horses have been carried off into Germany. All the
    farm-implements have been destroyed&mdash;and destroyed with a
    surprising ingenuity. The same parts were destroyed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"
       id="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span> in each instrument, so that
       an entire instrument could not be reconstructed. The farms
       could not have been brought under cultivation this year, had
       not the Government and the Red Cross lent their
       assistance.</p>

    <p>We are approaching Noyon, the birthplace of Calvin. This is
    one of the few towns the Hun spared in his retreat; he spared
    it not out of a belated altruism, but purely to serve his own
    convenience. There were some of the French civilians who
    weren't worth transporting to Germany. They would be too weak,
    or too old, or too young to earn their keep when he got them
    there. These he sorted out, irrespective of their family ties,
    and herded from the surrounding districts into Noyon. They were
    crowded into the houses and ordered under pain of death not to
    come out until they were given permission. They were further
    ordered to shutter all their windows and not to look out.</p>

    <p>As an old lady, who narrated the story, said, "We had no
    idea, Monsieur, what was to happen. <i>Les Boches</i> had been
    with us for nearly three years; it never entered our heads that
    they were leaving. When they took the last of our young girls
    from us and all who were strong among our men, it was something
    that they had done so often and so often. When they made us
    hide <span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"
       id="page163"></a>[pg 163]</span> in our houses, we thought
       it was only to prevent a disturbance. It is not easy to see
       your boys and girls marched away into slavery&mdash;Monsieur
       will understand that. Sometimes, on former occasions, the
       mothers had attacked <i>les Boches</i> and the young girls
       had become hysterical; we thought that it was to avoid such
       scenes that we were shut up in our houses. When darkness
       fell, we sat in our rooms without any lights, for they also
       were forbidden. All night long through our streets we heard
       the endless tramping of battalions, the clattering wheels of
       guns and limbers, the sharp orders, the halting and the
       marching taken up afresh. Towards dawn everything grew
       silent. At first it would be broken occasionally by the
       hurried trot of cavalry or the shuffling footsteps of a
       straggler. Then it grew into the absolute silence of death.
       It was nerve-racking and terrible. One could almost hear the
       breathing of the listening people in all the other houses. I
       do not know how time went or what was the hour. I could
       endure the suspense no longer. They might kill me, but ...
       Ah well, at my age after nearly three years with 'les
       Boches,' killing is a little matter! I crept down the
       passage and drew back the bolts. I was very gentle; a sentry
       might hear me. I opened the door just a crack. I expected to
       hear a rifle-shot ring out, but nothing
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"
       id="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span> happened. I opened it
       wider, and saw that the street was empty and that it was
       broad daylight. Then I waited&mdash;I do not know how long I
       waited. I crouched against the wall, huddled with terror.
       All this took much longer in the doing than in the telling.
       At last I could bear myself no longer. I tiptoed out on to
       the pavement&mdash;and, Monsieur will believe me, I expected
       to drop dead. But no one disturbed me. Then I heard a
       rustling. Doors everywhere were opening stealthily, ah, so
       stealthily! Some one else tiptoed out, and some one else,
       and some one else. We stood there staring, aghast at our
       daring. Suddenly we realised what had happened. The brutes
       had gone. We were free. It was indescribable, what
       followed&mdash;we ran together, weeping and embracing. At
       first we wept for gladness; soon we wept for sorrow. Our
       youth had departed; we were all old women or very ancient
       men. Two hours later our poilus came, like a blue-grey wave
       of laughter, fighting their way through the burning country
       that those swine had left in a sea of smoke and flames."</p>

    <p>And so that was why the Hun spared Noyon. But if he spared
    Noyon, he spared little else.<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"
       id="page165"></a>[pg 165]</span> Every village between here
       and the present front line has been levelled; every
       fruit-tree cut down. The wilful wickedness and pettiness of
       the crime stir one's heart to pity and his soul to white-hot
       anger. The people who did this must make payment in more
       than money; to settle such a debt blood is required.
       American soldiers who came to Europe to do a job and with no
       decided detestation of the Hun, are being taught by such
       landscapes. They know now why they came. The wounds of
       France are educating them.</p>

    <p>There has been a scheme proposed in America under which
    certain individual cities and towns in the States shall make
    themselves responsible for the re-building of certain
    individual cities and towns in the devastated areas. The scheme
    is noble; it has only one drawback, namely that it specialises
    effort and tends to ignore the immensity of the problem as a
    whole. I visited one of these towns&mdash;it is a town for
    which Philadelphia has made itself responsible. I wish the
    people of Philadelphia might get a glimpse of the task they
    have undertaken. There is a church-spire still standing; that
    is about all. The rest is a pile of bricks. In the midst of
    this havoc some Philadelphia ladies are living, one of whom is
    a nurse. They run a dispensary for the people who keep house
    for the most part in cellars and holes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page166"
       id="page166"></a>[pg 166]</span> in the ground. A doctor
       visits them to hold a clinic ever so often. They have a
       little warehouse, in which they keep the necessities for
       immediate relief work. They have a rest hut for soldiers.
       They employ whatever civilian labour they can hire for the
       roofing of some of the least damaged cottages; for this
       temporary reconstruction they provide the materials. When I
       was there, the place was well within range of enemy
       shell-fire. The approach had to be made by way of
       camouflaged roads. The sole anxiety of these brave women was
       that on account of their nearness to the front-line, the
       military might compel them to move back. In order to
       safeguard themselves against this and to create a good
       impression, they were making a strong point of entertaining
       whatever officers were billeted in this vicinity. Their
       effort to remain in this rural Gomorrah was as courageous as
       it was pathetic. "The people need us," they said, and then,
       "you don't think we'll be moved back, do you?" I thought
       they would, and I didn't think that the grateful officers
       would be able to prevent it&mdash;they were subalterns and
       captains for the most part. "But we once had a major to
       tea," they said. "A major!" I exclaimed, trying to look
       impressed, "Oh well, that makes a difference!"</p>

    <p>There was one unit I wished especially to visit;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page167"
       id="page167"></a>[pg 167]</span> it was a unit consisting
       entirely of women, sent over and financed by a women's
       college. When I was in America last October and heard that
       they were starting, I made up my mind that they were doomed
       to disappointment. I pictured the battlefield of the Somme
       as I had last seen it&mdash;a sea of mud stretching for
       miles, furrowed by the troughs of battered trenches, pitted
       every yard with shell-holes and smeared over with the
       wreckage of what once were human bodies. I could not imagine
       what useful purpose women could serve amid such
       surroundings. It seemed to me indecent that they should be
       allowed to go there. They were going to do reconstruction, I
       was told. Reconstruction! you can't reconstruct towns and
       villages the very foundations of which have been buried.
       There is a Bible phrase which expresses such annihilation,
       "The place thereof shall know it no more." Yes, only the
       names remain in one's memory&mdash;the very sites have been
       covered up and the contours of the landscape re-dug with
       high explosives. It took millions of pounds to work this
       havoc. Men tunnelled under-ground and sprung mines without
       warning. They climbed like birds of prey, into the heavens
       to hurl death from the clouds. They lined up their guns,
       tier upon tier, almost axle to axle in places, and at a
       given sign rained a deluge of corruption
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page168"
       id="page168"></a>[pg 168]</span> on a country miles in
       front, which they could not even discern. The infantry went
       over the top throwing bombs and piled themselves up into
       mounds of silence. Nations far away toiled day and night in
       factories&mdash;and all that they might achieve this
       repellant desolation. The innocence of the project made one
       smile&mdash;a handful of women sailing from America to
       reconstruct! To reconstruct will take ten times more effort
       than was required to destroy. More than eight hundred years
       ago William the Norman burnt his way through the North
       Country to Chester. Yorkshire has not yet recovered; it is
       still a wind-swept moorland. This women's college in America
       hoped to repair in our lifetime a ruin a million times more
       terrible. Their courage was depressing, it so exceeded the
       possible. They might love one village back to life, but....
       That is exactly what they are doing.</p>

    <p>I arrived at Grécourt on an afternoon in January. It is here
    that the women of the Smith College Unit have taken up their
    tenancy. We had extraordinary difficulty in finding the place.
    The surrounding country had been blasted and scorched by fire.
    There was no one left of whom we could enquire. Everything had
    perished. Barns, houses, everything habitable had been blown up
    by the departing Hun. As a study in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page169"
       id="page169"></a>[pg 169]</span> the painstaking completion
       of a purpose the scenes through which we passed almost
       called for admiration. Berlin had ordered her armies to
       destroy everything before withdrawing; they had obeyed with
       a loving thoroughness. The world has never seen such past
       masters in the art of demolition. Ever since they invaded
       Belgium, their hand has been improving. In the neighbourhood
       of Grécourt they have equalled, if not surpassed, their own
       best efforts. I would suggest to the Kaiser that this manly
       performance calls for a distribution of iron crosses. It is
       true that his armies were beaten and retiring; but does not
       that fact rather enhance their valour? They were retiring,
       yet there were those who were brave enough to delay their
       departure till they had achieved this final victory over old
       women and children to the lasting honour of their country.
       Such heroes are worthy to stand beside the sinkers of the
       <i>Lusitania</i>. It is not just that they should go
       unrecorded.</p>

    <p>In the midst of this hell I came across a tumbled château.
    Its roof, its windows, its stairways were gone; only the
    crumbling shell of its former happiness was left standing. A
    high wall ran about its grounds. The place must have been
    pleasant with flower-gardens once. There was an impressive
    entrance of wrought-iron, a porter's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"
       id="page170"></a>[pg 170]</span> lodge and a broad driveway.
       At the back I found rows of little wood-huts. There was a
       fragrance of log-fires burning. I was glad of that, for I
       had heard of the starving cold these women had had to endure
       through the first winter months of their tenure. On tapping
       at a door, I found the entire colony assembled. It was
       tea-time and Sunday. Ten out of the seventeen who form the
       colony were present. A box-stove, such as we use in our
       pioneer shacks in Canada, was throwing out a glow of
       cheeriness. Candles had been lighted. Little knicknacks of
       feminine taste had been hung here and there to disguise the
       bareness of the walls. A bed, in one corner, was carefully
       disguised as a couch. Save for the fact that there was no
       glass in the window&mdash;glass being unobtainable in France
       at present&mdash;one might easily have persuaded himself
       that he was back in America in the room of a
       girl-undergraduate.</p>

    <p>The method of my greeting furthered this illusion.
    Americans, both men and women, have an extraordinary
    self-poise, a gift for remaining normal in the most abnormal
    surroundings. They refuse to allow themselves to be surprised
    by any upheaval of circumstances. "I should worry," they seem
    to be saying, and press straight on with the job in hand. There
    was one small touch <span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"
       id="page171"></a>[pg 171]</span> which made the environment
       seem even more friendly and unexceptional. One of the girls,
       on being introduced, promptly read to me a letter which she
       had just received from my sister in America. It made this
       oasis in an encircling wilderness seem very much a part of a
       neighbourly world. This girl is an example of the varied
       experiences which have trained American women into becoming
       the nursemaids of the French peasantry.</p>

    <p>She was visiting relations in Liége when the war broke out.
    On the Sunday she went for a walk on the embattlements and was
    turned back. Baulked in this direction, she strolled out
    towards the country and found men digging trenches. That was
    the first she knew that war was rumoured. On the Tuesday, two
    days later, Hun shells were detonating on the house-tops. She
    was held prisoner in Liége for some months after the Forts had
    fallen and saw more than all the crimes against humanity that
    the Bryce Report has recorded. At last she disguised herself
    and contrived her escape into Holland. From there she worked
    her way back to America and now she is at Grécourt, starting
    shops in the villages, educating the children, and behaving
    generally as if to respond to the "Follow thou me" of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page172"
       id="page172"></a>[pg 172]</span> New Testament was an
       entirely unheroic proceeding for a woman.</p>

    <p>And what are these women doing at Grécourt? To condense
    their purpose into a phrase, I should say that by their example
    they are bringing sanity back into the lives of the French
    peasants. That is what the American Fund for French Wounded is
    doing at Blérancourt, what all these reconstruction units are
    doing in the devastated areas, and what the American Red Cross
    is doing on a much larger scale for the whole of France. At
    Grécourt they have a dispensary and render medical aid. If the
    cases are grave, they are sent to the American Hospital at
    Nesle. They hunt out the former tradespeople among the refugees
    and encourage them to re-start their shops, lending them the
    money for the purpose. If the men are captives in Germany, then
    their wives are helped to carry on the business in their
    absence and for their sakes. Groups of mothers are brought
    together and set to work on making clothes for themselves and
    their children. Schools are opened so that the children may be
    more carefully supervised. Two of the girls at Grécourt have
    learnt to plough, and are instructing the peasant women. Cows
    are kept and a dairy has been started to provide the
    under-nourished babies of the district. An
    automobile-dispensary <span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"
       id="page173"></a>[pg 173]</span> is sent out from the
       hospital at Nesle to visit the remoter districts. It has a
       seat along one side for the patient and the nurse. Over the
       seat is a rack for medicine and instruments. On the opposite
       side is a rack for splints and surgical dressings. On the
       floor of the car a shower-bath is arranged, which is so
       compact that it can be carried into the house where the
       water is to be heated. The water is put into a tub on a
       wooden base; while the doctor manipulates the pump for the
       shower, the nurse does the scrubbing. Most of the diseases
       among the children are due to dirt; the importance of
       keeping clean, which such colonies as that at Grécourt are
       impressing on all the people whom they serve, is doing much
       to improve the general state of health. In this direction,
       as in so many others, the most valuable contribution that
       they are making to their districts is not material and
       financial, but mental&mdash;the contribution of example and
       suggestion. Seventeen women cannot re-build in a day an
       external civilisation which has been blotted out by the
       savagery of a nation; but they can and they are re-building
       the souls of the human derelicts who have survived the
       savagery. This war is going to be won not by the combination
       of nations which has most men and guns, but by the side
       which possesses the highest spiritual qualities. The same is
       true of the countries which
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"
       id="page174"></a>[pg 174]</span> will wipe out the effects
       of war most quickly when the war is ended. The first
       countries to recover will be those which fight on in a new
       way, after peace has been signed, for the same ideals for
       which they have shed their blood. The sight of these
       American women, living helpfully and voluntarily for the
       sake of others among hideous surroundings, is a perpetual
       reminder to the dispirited refugees that, whatever else is
       lost, valiance and loyalty still survive.</p>

    <p>From Grécourt I went farther afield to Croix, Y and Matigny.
    Here a young architect is in charge of the reconstruction. No
    attempt is being made at present to re-build the farms
    entirely. Labour is difficult to obtain&mdash;it is all
    required for military purposes. The same applies to materials.
    Patching is the best that can be done. Just to get a roof over
    one corner of a ruin is as much as can be hoped for. Until that
    is done the people have to live in cellars, in shell-holes, in
    verminous dug-outs like beasts of prey or savages. Their
    position is far more deplorable than that of Indians, for they
    once knew the comforts of civilisation. For instance, I visited
    a farmer who before the war was a millionaire in French money.
    Many of the farmers of this district were; their acreages were
    large even by prairie standards. The American Red Cross has
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page175"
       id="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span> managed to reconstruct one
       room for him in a pile of debris which was once a spacious
       house. There he lives with his old wife, who, during the Hun
       occupation, became nearly blind and almost completely
       paralytic. His sons and daughters have been swept beyond his
       knowledge by the departing armies. Before the Huns left, he
       had to stand by and watch them uselessly lay waste his home
       and possessions. His trees are cut down. His barns are laid
       flat. His cattle are behind the German lines. At the age of
       seventy, he is starting all afresh and working harder than
       ever he did in his life. The young architect of the Red
       Cross visits him often. They sit in the little room of
       nights, erecting barns and houses more splendid than those
       that have vanished, but all in the green quiet of the
       untested future. They shall be standing by the time the
       captive sons come back. It is a game at which they play for
       the sake of the blinded mother; she listens smilingly,
       nodding her old head, her frail hands folded in her lap.</p>

    <p>These pictures which I have painted are typical of some of
    the things that the American Red Cross is doing. They are
    isolated examples, which by no means cover all its work. There
    are the rolling canteens which it has instituted, which follow
    the French armies. There are the rest
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"
       id="page176"></a>[pg 176]</span> houses it has built on the
       French line of communications for <i>poilus</i> who are
       going on leave or returning. There is the farm for the
       mutilated, where they are taught to be specialists in
       certain branches of agriculture, despite their physical
       curtailments. There is the great campaign against
       tuberculosis which it is waging. There are its
       well-conceived warehouses, stored with medical supplies and
       military and relief necessities, spreading in a great
       net-work of usefulness and connected by ambulance transport
       throughout the whole of the stricken part of France. There
       are its hospitals, both military and civil. There is the
       "Lighthouse" for men wounded in battle, founded by Miss Holt
       in Paris.</p>

    <p>I visited this Lighthouse; it is a place infinitely brave
    and pathetic. Most of the men were picked heroes at the war;
    they wear their decorations in proof of it. They are greater
    heroes than ever now. Nothing has more deeply moved me than my
    few hours among those sightless eyes. In many cases the faces
    are hideously marred, the eyelids being quite grown together.
    In several cases besides the eyes, the arms or legs have gone.
    I have talked and written a good deal about the courage which
    this war has inspired in ordinary men; but the courage of these
    blinded men, who once were ordinary, leaves me silent and
    appalled. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"
       id="page177"></a>[pg 177]</span> They are happy&mdash;how
       and why I cannot understand. Most of them have been taught
       at the Lighthouse how to overcome their disability and are
       earning their living as weavers, stenographers, potters,
       munition-workers. Quite a number of them have families to
       support. The only complaint that is made against them by
       their brother-workmen is that they are too rapid; they set
       too strenuous a pace for the men with eyes. It is a fact
       that in all trades where sensitiveness of touch is an asset,
       blindness has increased their efficiency. This is peculiarly
       so at the Sévres pottery-works where I saw them making the
       moulds for retorts. A soldier, who was teaching a seeing
       person Braille, explained his own quickness of perception
       when he exclaimed, "Ah, madame, it is your eyes which
       prevent you from seeing!"</p>

    <p>I heard some of the stories of the men. There was a captain
    who, after he had been wounded and while there was yet time to
    save his sight, insisted on being taken to his General that he
    might inform him about a German mine. When his mission was
    completed, his chance of seeing was forever ended.</p>

    <p>There was a lieutenant who was blinded in a raid and left
    for dead out in No Man's Land. Just before he became
    unconscious, he placed two lumps of earth in line in the
    direction which led <span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"
       id="page178"></a>[pg 178]</span> back to his own trenches.
       He knew the direction by the sound of the retreating
       footsteps. Whenever he came to himself he groped his way a
       little nearer to France and before he fainted again,
       registered the direction with two more lumps of earth placed
       in line. It took him a day to crawl back.</p>

    <p>There was another man who illustrated in a finer way that
    saying, "It is your eyes which prevent you from seeing." This
    man before the war was a village-priest, and no credit to his
    calling. He had a sister who had spent her youth for him and
    worshipped him beyond everything in the world. He took her
    adoration brutally for granted. At the outbreak of hostilities
    he joined the army, serving bravely in the ranks till he was
    hopelessly blinded. Having always been a thoroughly selfish
    man, his privation drove him nearly to madness. He had always
    used the world; now for the first time he had been used by it.
    His viciousness broke out in blasphemy; he hated both God and
    man. He made no distinction between people in the mass and the
    people who tried to help him. His whole desire was to inflict
    as much pain as he himself suffered. When his sister came to
    visit him, he employed every ingenuity of word and gesture to
    cause her agony. Do what she would, he refused to allow her
    love <span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"
       id="page179"></a>[pg 179]</span> either to reach or comfort
       him. She was only a simple peasant woman. In her grief and
       loneliness she thought matters out and arrived at what
       seemed to her a practical solution. On her next visit to the
       hospital she asked to see the doctor. She was taken to him
       and made her request. "I love my brother," she said; "I have
       always given him everything. He has lost his eyes and he
       cannot endure it. Because I love him, I could bear it
       better. I have been thinking, and I am sure it is possible:
       I want you to remove my eyes and to put them into his empty
       sockets."</p>

    <p>When the priest was told of her offer, he laughed derisively
    at her for a fool. Then the reason she had given for her
    intended sacrifice was told to him, "Because I love him, I
    could bear it better." He fell silent. All that day he refused
    food; in the eternal darkness, muffled by his bandages, he was
    arriving at the truth: she had been willing to suffer what he
    was now suffering, because she loved him. The hand of love
    would have made the burden bearable and, if for her, why not
    for himself? At last, after years of refusal, the simplicity of
    her tenderness reached and touched him. Presently he was
    discharged from hospital and taken in hand by the teachers of
    the blind, who taught him to play the organ. One day his sister
    came and led him back <span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"
       id="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span> to his village-parish.
       Before the war, by his example, he was a danger to God and
       man; now he sets a very human example of sainthood,
       labouring without ceasing for others more fortunate than
       himself. He has increased his efficiency for service by his
       blindness. Of him it is absolutely true that it was his eyes
       that prevented him from seeing&mdash;from seeing the
       splendour that lay hidden in himself, no less than in his
       fellow creatures.</p>

    <p>So far I have sketched in the main what the war of
    compassion is doing for the repatriés&mdash;the captured French
    civilians sent back from Germany&mdash;and for the refugees of
    the devastated areas, who have either returned to their ruined
    farms and villages or were abandoned as useless when the Hun
    retired. To complete the picture it remains to describe what is
    being done for the civilian population which has always lived
    in the battle area of the French armies.</p>

    <p>The question may be asked why civilians have been allowed to
    live here. Curiously enough it is due to the extraordinary
    humanity of the French Government which makes allowances for
    the almost religious attachment of the peasant to his tiny plot
    of land; it is an attachment which is as instinctive and
    fiercely jealous as that of a cat for her young. He will endure
    shelling, gassing <span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"
       id="page181"></a>[pg 181]</span> and all the horrors that
       scientific invention has produced; he will see his cottage
       and his barns shattered by bombs and siege-guns, but he will
       not leave the fields that he has tilled and toiled over,
       unless he is driven out at the point of the bayonet. I have
       been told, though I have never seen it, that behind quiet
       parts of the line, French peasants will gather in their
       harvest actually in full sight of the Hun. Shells may be
       falling, but they go stolidly on with their work. There is
       another reason for this leniency of the Government: they
       have enough refugees on their hands already and are not
       going in search of further trouble, until the trouble is
       forced upon them by circumstances.</p>

    <p>As may be imagined, these people live under physical
    conditions that are terrible. They consist for the most part of
    women and children; the women are over-worked and the children
    are neglected. Skin diseases and vermin abound. Clothes are
    negligible. Washing is a forgotten luxury. Much havoc is
    wrought by asphyxiating gases which drift across the front-line
    into the back-country. To the adults are issued protective
    masks like those that the soldiers wear, but the children do
    not know how to use them. Many of them are orphans, and live
    like little animals on roots and offal; for shelter they seek
    holes in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page182"
       id="page182"></a>[pg 182]</span> ground. The American Red
       Cross is specialising on its efforts to reclaim these
       children, realising that whatever happens to the adults, the
       children are the hope of the world.</p>

    <p>The part of the Front to which I went to study this work was
    made famous in 1914 by the disembowellings, shootings and
    unspeakable indecencies that were perpetrated there. Near by is
    the little village in which Sister Julie risked her life by
    refusing to allow her wounded to be butchered. She wears the
    Legion of Honour now. In the same neighbourhood there lives a
    Mayor who, after having seen his young wife murdered, protected
    her murderers from the lynch-law of the mob when next day the
    town was recaptured. In the same district there is a meadow
    where fifteen old men were done to death, while a Hun officer
    sat under an oak-tree, drinking mocking toasts to the victims
    of each new execution.</p>

    <p>The influence of more than three years of warfare has not
    been elevating, as far as these peasants are concerned. As
    early as July, a little over a month from its arrival in
    France, an S.O.S. was sent out by the Préfet of the department,
    begging the American Red Cross to come and help. In addition to
    the refugees of old standing, 350 children had been suddenly
    put into his care. He had nothing but a temporary shelter for
    them and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"
       id="page183"></a>[pg 183]</span> his need for assistance was
       acute. Within a few hours the Red Cross had despatched eight
       workers&mdash;a doctor, nurse, bacteriologist, an
       administrative director and two women to take charge of the
       bedding, food and clothing. A camionette loaded with
       condensed milk and other relief necessities was sent by
       road. On the arrival of the party, they found the children
       herded together in old barracks, dirty and unfurnished, with
       no sanitary appliances whatsoever. The sick were crowded
       together with the well. Of the 350 children, twenty-one were
       under one year of age, and the rest between one and eight
       years. The reason for this sudden crisis was that the Huns
       were bombing the villages behind the lines with asphyxiating
       gas. The military authorities had therefore withdrawn all
       children who were too young to adjust their masks
       themselves, at the same time urging their mothers to carry
       on the patriotic duty of gathering in the harvest. It was
       the machinery of mercy which had been built up in six months
       about this nucleus of eight persons that I set out to
       visit.</p>

    <p>The roads were crowded with the crack troops of
    France&mdash;the Foreign Legion, the Tailleurs, the
    Moroccans&mdash;all marching in one direction, eastward to the
    trenches. There were rumours of something immense about to
    happen&mdash;no one <span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"
       id="page184"></a>[pg 184]</span> knew quite what. Were we
       going to put on a new offensive or were we going to resist
       one? Many answers were given: they were all guesswork.
       Meanwhile, our progress was slow; we were continually
       halting to let brigades of artillery and regiments of
       infantry pour into the main artery of traffic from lanes and
       side-roads. When we had backed our car into hedges to give
       them room to pass, we watched the sea of faces. They were
       stern and yet laughing, elated and yet childish, eloquent of
       the love of living and yet familiar with their old friend,
       Death. They knew that something big was to be demanded of
       them; before the demand had been made, they had determined
       to give to the ultimate of their strength. There was a
       spiritual resolution about their faces which made all their
       expressions one&mdash;the uplifted expression of the
       unconquered soul of France. That expression blotted out
       their racial differences. It did not matter that they were
       Arabs, Negroes, Normans, Parisians; they owned to one
       nationality&mdash;the nationality of martyrdom&mdash;and
       they marched with a single purpose, that freedom might be
       restored to the world.</p>

    <p>When we reached the city to which we journeyed, night had
    fallen. There was something sinister about our entry; we were
    veiled in fog, and crept through the gate and beneath the
    ramparts <span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"
       id="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span> with extinguished head
       lights. Scarcely any one was abroad. Those whom we passed,
       loomed out of the mist in silence, passed stealthily and
       vanished.</p>

    <p>This city is among the most beautiful in France; until
    recently, although within range of the Hun artillery, it had
    been left undisturbed. In return the French had spared an
    equally beautiful city on the other side of the line. This
    clemency, shown towards two gems of architecture, was the
    result of one of those silent bargains that are arranged in the
    language of the guns. But the bargain had been broken by the
    time I arrived. Bombing planes had been over; the Allied planes
    had retaliated. Houses, emptied like cart-loads of bricks into
    the street, were significant of the ruin that was pending. Any
    moment the orchestra of destruction might break into its
    overture. Without cessation one could hear a distant booming.
    The fiddlers of death were tuning up.</p>

    <p>Early next morning I went to see the Préfet. He is an old
    man, whose courage has made him honoured wherever the French
    tongue is spoken. Others have thought of their own safety and
    withdrawn into the interior. Never from the start has his sense
    of duty wavered. Night and day he has laboured incessantly for
    the refugees, whom he refers to always as "my suffering
    people." <span class="pagenum"><a name="page186"
       id="page186"></a>[pg 186]</span> He kept me waiting for some
       time. Directly I entered he volunteered the explanation: he
       had just received word from the military authorities that
       the whole of his civil population must be immediately
       evacuated. To evacuate a civil population means to tear it
       up and transplant it root and branch, with no more of its
       possession than can be carried as hand-baggage. Some 75,000
       people would be made homeless directly the Préfet published
       the order.</p>

    <p>It was a dramatic moment, full of tragedy. I glanced out
    into the square filled with wintry sunlight. I took note of the
    big gold gates and the monuments. I watched the citizens
    halting here and there to chat, or going about their errands
    with a quiet confidence. All this was to be shattered; it had
    been decided. The same thing was to happen here as had happened
    at Yprés. The bargain was off. The enemy city, the other side
    of the line, was to be shelled; this city had to take the
    consequences. The bargain was off not only as far as the city
    was concerned, but also as regards its inhabitants' happiness.
    They had homes to-day; they would be fugitives to-morrow. Then
    I looked at the old Préfet, who had to break the news to them.
    He was sitting at his table in his uniform of office,
    supporting his head in his tired
    hands.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"
       id="page187"></a>[pg 187]</span>

    <p>"What are you going to do?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"I have called on the Croix Rouge Américaine to help me," he
    said. "They have helped me before; they will help me again.
    These Americans&mdash;I have never been to America&mdash;but
    they are my friends. Since they came, they have looked after my
    babies. Their doctors and nurses have worked day and night for
    my suffering people. They are silent; but they do things. There
    is love in their hands."</p>

    <p>While I was still with him the Red Cross officials arrived.
    They had already wired to Paris. Their lorries and ambulances
    were converging from all points to meet the emergency. They
    undertook at once to place all their transport facilities at
    his disposal. They had started their arrangements for the
    handling of the children. Extra personnel were being rushed to
    the spot. There was one unit already in the city. They had
    hoped to go nearer to the Front, but on arriving had learnt
    that their permission had been cancelled. It was a bit of luck.
    They could set to work at once.</p>

    <p>I knew this unit and went out to find it. It was composed of
    American society girls, who had been protected all their lives
    from ugliness. They had sailed from New York with the vaguest
    ideas of the war conditions they would encounter; they
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page188"
       id="page188"></a>[pg 188]</span> believed that they were
       needed to do a nurse-maid's job for France. Their original
       purpose was to found a crêche for the babies of women
       munition-workers. When they got to Paris they found that
       such institutions were not wanted. They at once changed
       their programme, and asked to be allowed to take their
       crêche into the army zone and convert it into a hospital for
       refugee children. There were interminable delays due to
       passport formalities&mdash;the delays dragged on for three
       months. During those three months they were called on for no
       sacrifice; they lived just as comfortably as they had done
       in New York and, consequently, grew disgusted. They had
       sailed for France prepared to give something that they had
       never given before, and France did not seem to want it. At
       last their passports came; without taking any chances, they
       got out of Paris and started for the Front. Their haste was
       well-timed; no sooner had they departed than a message
       arrived, cancelling their permissions. They had reached the
       doomed city in which I was at present, two days before its
       sentence was pronounced. Within four hours of their arrival
       they had had their first experience of being bombed. Their
       intention had been to open their hospital in a town still
       nearer to the front-line. The hospital was prepared and
       waiting for them. But in the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page189"
       id="page189"></a>[pg 189]</span> last few days the military
       situation had changed. A hospital so near the trenches stood
       a good chance of being destroyed by shell-fire; so once
       again the unit was held up. It volunteered to abandon its
       idea of running the hospital for children; it would run it
       as a first aid hospital for the armies. The offer was
       refused. These girls, whose gravest interest a year ago had
       been the season's dances and the latest play, were
       determined to experience the thrill of sacrifice. So here
       they were in the doomed city, as the Red Cross officials
       said, "by luck"&mdash;the very place where they were most
       needed.</p>

    <p>When I visited them, after leaving the Préfet's, they had
    not yet heard that they were to be allowed to stay. They had
    heard nothing of the city's sentence or of the evacuation of
    the civil population. All they knew was that the hospital,
    which had been appointed with their money, was only a few
    kilometres away and that they were forbidden even to see it.
    They were gloomy with the fear that within a handful of days
    they would be again walking the boulevards of Paris. When the
    news was broken to them of the part they were to play, the full
    significance of it did not dawn on them at once. "But we don't
    want anything easy," they complained; "this isn't the Front."
    "It will be soon," the official told them. When
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"
       id="page190"></a>[pg 190]</span> they heard that they
       cheered up; then their share in the drama was explained. In
       all probability the city would soon be under constant
       shell-fire. Refugees would be pouring back from the forward
       country. The people of the city itself had to be helped to
       escape before the bombardment commenced. They would have to
       stay there taking care of the children, packing them into
       lorries, driving ambulances, rendering first aid, taking the
       wounded and decrepit out of danger and always returning to
       it again themselves. As the certainty of the risk and
       service was impressed on them their faces brightened. Risk
       and service, that was what they most desired; they were
       girls, but they hungered to play a soldier's part. They had
       only dreamt of serving when they had sailed from New York.
       Those three months of waiting had stung their pride. It was
       in Paris that the dream of risk had commenced. They would
       make France want them. Their chance had come.</p>

    <p>When I came out into the streets again the word was
    spreading. Carts were being loaded in front of houses.
    Everything on wheels, from wagons to perambulators, was being
    piled up. Everything on four legs, dogs, cattle, horses, was
    being harnessed and made to do its share in hauling. We left
    the city, going back to the next point where the refugees would
    be cared for. On <span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"
       id="page191"></a>[pg 191]</span> either side of the road, as
       far as eye could stretch, trenches had been dug, barricades
       thrown up, blockades and wire-entanglements constructed. It
       all lay very quiet beneath the sunlight. It seemed a kind of
       preposterous pretence. One could not imagine these fields as
       a scene of battle, sweating torture and agony and death. I
       looked back at the city, one of the most beautiful in
       France, growing hazy in the distance with its spires and its
       ramparts. Impossible! Then I remembered the carts being
       hurriedly loaded and the uplifted faces of those American
       girls. Where had I seen their expression before? Yes.
       Strange that they should have caught it! Their expression
       was the same as that which I had noticed on the Tailleurs,
       the Foreign Legion and the Moroccans&mdash;the crack troops
       of France.... So they had become that already! At the first
       hint of danger, their courage had taken command; they had
       risen into soldiers.</p>

    <p>Through villages swarming with troops and packed with
    ordnance we arrived at an old caserne, which has been converted
    into the children's hospital of the district. It is in charge
    of one of the first of America's children's specialists. While
    he works among the refugees, his wife, who is a sculptress,
    makes masks for the facially mutilated. He has brought with him
    from the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"
       id="page192"></a>[pg 192]</span> States some of his
       students, but his staff is in the main cosmopolitan. One of
       his nurses is an Australian, who was caught at the outbreak
       of hostilities in Austria and because of her knowledge,
       despite her nationality, was allowed to help to organise the
       Red Cross work of the enemy. Another is a French woman who
       wears the Croix de Guerre with the palm. She saved her
       wounded from the fury of the Hun when her village was lost,
       and helped to get them back to safety after it had been
       recaptured. The Matron is Swedish and Belgian. The
       ambulance-drivers are some of the American boys who saw
       service with the French armies. In this group of workers
       there are as many stories as there are nationalities.</p>

    <p>If the workers have their stories, so have the five hundred
    little patients. This barrack, converted into a hospital, is
    full of babies, the youngest being only six days old when I was
    there. Many of the children have no parents. Others have lost
    their mothers; their fathers are serving in the trenches. It is
    not always easy to find out how they became orphans; there are
    such plentiful chances of losing parents who live continually
    under shell-fire. One little boy on being asked where his
    mother was, replied gravely, "My Mama, she is dead. Les Boches,
    they put a gun to 'er 'ead. She is finished; I 'ave no
    Mama."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193"
       id="page193"></a>[pg 193]</span>

    <p>The unchildlike stoicism of these children is appalling. I
    spent two days among them and heard no crying. Those who are
    sick, lie motionless as waxen images in their cots. Those who
    are supposedly well, sit all day brooding and saying nothing.
    When first they arrive, their faces are earth-coloured. The
    first thing they have to be taught is how to be children. They
    have to be coaxed and induced to play; even then they soon grow
    weary. They seem to regard mere playing as frivolous and
    indecorous; and so it is in the light of the tragedies they
    have witnessed. Children of seven have seen more of horror in
    three years than most old men have read about in a life-time.
    Many of them have been captured by and recaptured from the
    Huns. They have been in villages where the dead lay in piles
    and not even the women were spared. They have been present
    while indecencies were worked upon their mothers. They have
    seen men hanged, shot, bayoneted and flung to roast in burning
    houses. The pictures of all these things hang in their eyes.
    When they play, it is out of politeness to the kind Americans;
    not because they derive any pleasure from it.</p>

    <p>Night is the troublesome time. The children hide under their
    beds with terror. The nurses have to go the rounds continually.
    If the children <span class="pagenum"><a name="page194"
       id="page194"></a>[pg 194]</span> would only cry, they would
       give warning. But instead, they creep silently out from
       between the sheets and crouch against the floor like dumb
       animals. Dumb animals! That is what they are when first they
       are brought in. Their most primitive instincts for the
       beginnings of cleanliness seem to have vanished. They have
       been fished out of caves, ruined dug-outs, broken houses.
       They are as full of skin-diseases as the beggar who sat
       outside Dives' gate, only they have had no dogs to lick
       their sores. They have lived on offal so long that they have
       the faces of the extremely aged. And their hatred! Directly
       you utter the word "Boche," all the little night-gowned
       figures sit up in their cots and curse. When they have done
       cursing, of their own accord, they sing the
       Marseillaise.</p>

    <p>Surely if God listens to prayers of vengeance, He will
    answer the husky petitions of these victims of Hun cruelty! The
    quiet, just, deep-seated venom of these babies will work the
    Hun more harm than many batteries. Their fathers come back from
    the trenches to see them. On leaving, they turn to the American
    nurses, "We shall fight better now," they say, "because we know
    that you are taking care of them."</p>

    <p>When those words are spoken, the American Red Cross knows
    that it is achieving its object
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"
       id="page195"></a>[pg 195]</span> and is winning its war of
       compassion. The whole drive of all its effort is to win the
       war in the shortest possible space of time. It is in Europe
       to save children for the future, to re-kindle hope in broken
       lives, to mitigate the toll of unavoidable suffering, but
       first and foremost to help men to fight
       better.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"

    <h2>IV</h2>

    <h2>THE LAST WAR</h2>

    <p><i>The last war!</i> I heard the phrase for the first time
    on the evening after Great Britain had declared war. I was in
    Quebec en route for England, wondering whether my ship was to
    be allowed to sail. There had been great excitement all day,
    bands playing the Marseillaise, Frenchmen marching arm-in-arm
    singing, orators, gesticulating and haranguing from balconies,
    street-corners and the base of statues.</p>

    <p>Now that the blue August night was falling and every one was
    released from work, the excitement was redoubled. Quebec was
    finding in war an opportunity for carnival. Throughout all the
    pyramided city the Tri-colour and the Union Jack were waving.
    At the foot of the Heights, the broad basin of the St. Lawrence
    was a-drift in the dusk with fluttering pennons. They looked
    like homing birds, settling in dovecotes of the masts and
    rigging.</p>

    <p>As night deepened, Chinese lanterns were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"
       id="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span> lighted and carried on
       poles through the narrow streets. Troops of merry-makers
       followed them, blowing horns, dragging bells, tin-cans,
       anything that would make a noise and express high spirits.
       They linked arms with girls as they marched and were lost,
       laughing in the dusk. If a French reservist could be found
       who was sailing in the first ship bound for the slaughter,
       he became the hero of the hour and was lifted shoulder high
       at the head of the procession. War was a brave game at which
       to play. This was to be a short war and a merry one. Down
       with the Germans! Up with France! Hurrah for the entente
       cordiale!</p>

    <p>Beneath the coronet of stars on the Heights of Abraham the
    spirit of Wolfe kept watch and brooded. It was under these
    circumstances, that I heard the phrase for the first
    time&mdash;<i>the last war</i>.</p>

    <p>The street was blocked with a gaping crowd. All the faces
    were raised to an open window, two storeys up, from which the
    frame had been taken out. Inside the building one could hear
    the pounding of machinery, for it was here that the most
    important paper of Quebec was printed. Across a huge white
    sheet a man on a hanging platform painted the latest European
    cables. A cluster of electric lights illuminated him strongly;
    but he was not the centre of the crowd's attention. In the
    window stood another man. Like
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page198"
       id="page198"></a>[pg 198]</span> myself he was waiting for
       his ship to sail, but not to England&mdash;to France. He was
       a returning French reservist. Across the many miles of ocean
       the hand of duty had stretched and touched him; he was
       ecstatically glad that he was wanted. In those first days
       this ecstasy of gladness was a little hard to understand.
       Thank God we all share it instinctively now. He was speaking
       excitedly, addressing the crowd. They cheered him; they were
       in a mood to cheer anybody. His face was thin with
       earnestness; he was a spirit-man. He waved aside their
       applause with impatience. He was trying to inspire them with
       his own intensity. In the intervals between the shouting, I
       caught some of his words, "I am setting out to fight the
       last war&mdash;the war of humanity which will bring
       universal peace and friendship to the world."</p>

    <p>A sailor behind me spat. He was drunk and feeling the need
    of sympathy. He began to explain to me the reason. He was a
    fireman on one of the steamers in the basin and a reservist in
    the British Navy. He had received his orders that day to report
    back in England for duty; he knew that he was going to be
    torpedoed on his voyage across the Atlantic. How did he know?
    He had had a vision. Sailors always had visions
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page199"
       id="page199"></a>[pg 199]</span> before they were drowned.
       It was to combat this vision that he had got drunk.</p>

    <p>I shook him off irritably. One didn't require the
    superstitions of an alcoholic imagination to emphasize the new
    terror which had overtaken the world. There was enough of fear
    in the air already. All this spurious gaiety&mdash;what was it?
    Nothing but the chatter of lonely children who were afraid to
    listen to the silence&mdash;afraid lest they might hear the
    creaking footstep of death upon the stairs. And these candles,
    lighting up the fringes of the night&mdash;they were nothing
    but a vain pretence that the darkness had not gathered.</p>

    <p>But this spirit-man framed in the window, he was genuine and
    different. Yesterday we should have passed him in the street
    unnoticed; to-day the mantle of prophecy clothed him. Within
    two months he might be dead&mdash;horribly dead with a bayonet
    through him. That thought was in the minds of all who watched
    him; it gave him an added authority. Yet he was not thinking of
    himself, of wounds, of death; he was not even thinking of
    France. He was thinking of humanity: "I am setting out to fight
    the last war&mdash;the war of humanity which will bring
    universal peace and friendship to the world."</p>

    <p>Since the war started, how often have we heard
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page200"
       id="page200"></a>[pg 200]</span> that phrase&mdash;<i>the
       last war!</i> It became the battle-cry of all
       recruiting-men, who would have fought under no other
       circumstances, joined up now so that this might be the final
       carnage. Nations left their desks and went into battle
       voluntarily, long before self-interest forced them, simply
       because organised murder so disgusted them that they were
       determined by weight of numbers to make this exhibition of
       brutality the last.</p>

    <p>Before Europe burst into flames in 1914, we believed that
    the last war had been already fought. The most vivid
    endorsement of this belief came out of Germany in a book which,
    to my mind, up to that time was the strongest peace-argument in
    modern literature. It was so strong that the Kaiser's
    Government had the author arrested and every copy that could be
    found destroyed. Nevertheless, over a million were secretly
    printed and circulated in Germany, and it was translated into
    every major European language. The book I refer to was known
    under its American title as, <i>The Human Slaughter-House</i>.
    It told very simply how men who had played the army game of
    sticking dummies, found themselves called upon to stick their
    brother-men; how they obeyed at first, then sickened at sight
    of their own handiwork, until finally the rank and file on both
    sides flung down their arms, banded
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page201"
       id="page201"></a>[pg 201]</span> themselves together and
       refused to carry out the orders of their generals. There was
       no declaration of peace; in that moment national boundaries
       were abolished.</p>

    <p>In 1912 this sounded probable. I remember the American
    press-comments. They all agreed that national prejudices had
    been broken down to such an extent by socialism and friendly
    intercourse, that never again would statesmen be able to launch
    attacks of nations against nations. Governments might declare
    war; the peoples whom they governed would merely overthrow
    them. The world had become too common-sense to commit murder on
    so vast a scale.</p>

    <p>Had it? The world in general might have: but Germany had
    not. The argument of <i>The Human Slaughter-House</i> proposed
    by a German in protest against what he foresaw was surely
    coming, turned out to be a bad guess. It made no allowance for
    what happens when a mad dog starts running through the world.
    One may be tender-hearted. One may not like killing dogs. One
    may even be an anti-vivisectionist; but when a dog is mad, the
    only humanitarian thing to do is to kill it. If you don't, the
    women and children pay the penalty.</p>

    <p>We have had our illustration in Russia of what occurs when
    one side flings away its arms, practising
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"
       id="page202"></a>[pg 202]</span> the idealistic reasonings
       which this book propounds: the more brutal side conquers.
       While the Blonde Beast runs abroad spreading rabies, the
       only idealist who counts is the idealist who carries a rifle
       on his shoulder&mdash;the only gospel to which the world
       listens is the gospel which saviours are dying for.</p>

    <p>The last war! It took us all by surprise. We had believed so
    utterly in peace; now we had to prove our faith by being
    prepared to die for it. If we did not die, this war would not
    be the last; it would be only the preface to the next. To
    paraphrase the words of Mr. Wells, "We had been prepared to
    take life in a certain way and life had taken us, as it takes
    every generation, in an entirely different way. We had been
    prepared to be altruistic pacifists, and ..."</p>

    <p>And here we are, in this year of 1918, engaged upon the
    bloodiest war of all time, harnessing the muscle and
    brain-power of the universe to one end&mdash;that we may
    contrive new and yet more deadly methods of butchering our
    fellow men. The men whom we kill, we do not hate individually.
    The men whom we kill, we do not see when they are dead. We
    scald them with liquid fire; we stifle them with gas; we drop
    volcanoes on them from the clouds; we pull firing-levers three,
    ten, even fifteen miles away and hurl them
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"
       id="page203"></a>[pg 203]</span> into eternity unconfessed.
       And this we do with pity in our hearts, both for them and
       for ourselves. And why? Because they have given us no
       choice. They have promised, unless we defend ourselves, to
       snatch our souls from us and fashion them afresh into souls
       which shall bear the stamp of their own image. Of their
       souls we have seen samples; they date back to the dark
       ages&mdash;the souls of Cain, Judas and Cæsar Borgia were
       not unlike them. Of what such souls are capable they have
       given us examples in Belgium, captured France and in the
       living dead whom they return by way of Evian. We would
       rather forego our bodies than so exchange our souls. A
       Germanised world is like a glimpse of madness; the very
       thought strikes terror to the heart. Yet it is to Germanise
       the world that Germany is waging war to-day&mdash;that she
       may confer upon us the benefits of her own proved
       swinishness. There is nothing left for us but to fight for
       our souls like men.</p>

    <p>The last war! We believed that at first, but as the years
    dragged on the certainty became an optimism, the optimism a
    dream which we well-nigh knew to be impossible. We have always
    known that we would beat Germany&mdash;we have never doubted
    that. But could we beat her so thoroughly that she would never
    dare to reperpetrate this horror? Could we prove to her that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"
       id="page204"></a>[pg 204]</span> war is not and never was a
       paying way of conducting business? Men began to smile when
       we spoke of this war as the last. "There have always been
       wars," they said; "this one is not the last&mdash;there will
       be others."</p>

    <p>If it is not to be the last, we have cheated ourselves. We
    have cheated the men who have died for us. Our chief ideal in
    fighting is taken away. Many a lad who moulders in a stagnant
    trench, laid down his life for this sole purpose, that no
    children of the future ages should have to pass through his
    Gethsemane. He consciously gave himself up as a scapegoat, that
    the security of human sanity should be safeguarded against a
    recurrence of this enormity. The spirit-man, framed in the
    dusky window above the applauding crowds in Quebec, was typical
    of all these men who have made the supreme sacrifice. His words
    utter the purpose that was in all their hearts, "I am setting
    out to fight the last war&mdash;the war of humanity which will
    bring universal peace and freedom to the world."</p>

    <p>That promise was becoming a lie; it is capable of fulfilment
    now. The dream became possible in April, 1917, when America
    took up her cross of martyrdom. Great Britain, France and the
    United States, the three great promise-keeping nations, are
    standing side by side. They together,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page205"
       id="page205"></a>[pg 205]</span> if they will when the war
       is ended, can build an impregnable wall for peace about the
       world. The plunderer who knew that it was not Great Britain,
       nor France, nor America, but all three of them united as
       Allies that he had to face, no matter how tempted he was to
       prove that armed force meant big business, would be
       persuaded to expand his commerce by more legitimate methods.
       Whether this dream is to be accomplished will be decided not
       upon any battlefield but in the hearts of the civilians of
       all three countries&mdash;particularly in those of America
       and Great Britain. The soldiers who have fought and suffered
       together, can never be anything but friends.</p>

    <p>My purpose in writing this account of America in France has
    been to give grounds for understanding and appreciation; it has
    been to prove that the highest reward that either America or
    Great Britain can gain as a result of its heroism is an
    Anglo-American alliance, which will fortify the world against
    all such future terrors. There never ought to have been
    anything but alliance between my two great countries. They
    speak the same tongue, share a common heritage and pursue the
    same loyalties. Had we not blundered in our destinies, there
    would never have been occasion for anything but generosity.</p>

    <p>The opportunity for generosity has come again.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"
       id="page206"></a>[pg 206]</span> Any man or woman who,
       whether by design or carelessness, attempts to mar this
       growing friendship is perpetrating a crime against humanity
       as grave as that of the first armed Hun who stepped across
       the Belgian threshold. It were better for them that
       mill-stones were hung about their necks and they were cast
       into the sea, than ...</p>

    <p>God is giving us our chance. The magnanimities of the
    Anglo-Saxon races are rising to greet one another. If those
    magnanimities are welcomed and made permanent, our
    soldier-idealists will not have died in vain. Then we shall
    fulfil for them their promise, "We are setting out to fight the
    last war."</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
